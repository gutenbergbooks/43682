baneful influence of the Evil Eye. May I use spells for them or
not?&rdquo; The Prophet said, &ldquo;Yes; for if there were anything in
the world which would overcome fate, it would be the Evil
Eye.&rdquo;&mdash;Misk&acirc;t, xxi.&ndash;i. Part II.</p>
<p>The belief in the baneful influence of the Evil Eye prevails
widely.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e315src" href="#xd21e315" name=
"xd21e315src">1</a> According to Pliny,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e318src" href="#xd21e318" name="xd21e318src">2</a> it was one of
the special superstitions of the people of India, and at the present
day it forms an important part of the popular belief. But the
investigation of its principles is far from easy. It is very closely
connected with a number of kindred ideas on the subject of diabolical
influence, and few natives care to speak about it except in a furtive
way. In fact, it is far too serious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2"
href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>a matter to be discussed lightly.
Walking about villages, you will constantly see special marks on
houses, and symbols and devices of various kinds, which are certainly
intended to counteract it; but hardly any one cares directly to explain
the real motive, and if you ask the meaning of them, you will almost
invariably be told that they are purely decorative, or that they have
been made with some object which obviously conceals the real basis of
the practice.</p>
<p>One, and perhaps the most common theory of the Evil Eye is that
&ldquo;when a child is born, an invisible spirit is born with it; and
unless the mother keeps one breast tied up for forty days, while she
feeds the child with the other (in which case the spirit dies of
hunger), the child grows up with the endowment of the Evil Eye, and
whenever any person so endowed looks at anything constantly, something
will happen to it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e325src" href=
"#xd21e325" name="xd21e325src">3</a> So, in Ireland we are told that
&ldquo;the gift comes by Nature and is born with one, though it may not
be called into exercise unless circumstances arise to excite the power;
then it comes to act like a spirit of bitter and malicious envy that
radiates a poisonous atmosphere, which chills and blights everything
within its reach.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e328src" href=
"#xd21e328" name="xd21e328src">4</a></p>
<p>In Bombay the &ldquo;blast of the Evil Eye is supposed to be a form
of spirit possession. In Western India all witches and wizards are said
to be, as a rule, evil-eyed. Of the rest, those persons only who are
born under certain circumstances are believed to be evil-eyed. The
circumstances are as follows:&mdash;Among the Hindus it is believed
that when a woman is pregnant, she begins to conceive peculiar longings
from the day of conception, or from the fifth month. They consist in
eating various fruits and sweetmeats, in walking under deep shades, or
in gardens where brooks gurgle, or in putting on rich clothes or
ornaments, and in many other like things. If in the case of any woman
these desires are not gratified, the child whom she gives birth to
becomes weak and voracious, and is said to have an Evil Eye. If
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>such a person sees a man or woman eat anything which
he feels a longing for, the eater either vomits what he or she has
eaten, or falls sick. By some it is believed that if a person come from
without at the time of dinner, and enters the house without washing his
feet, the man who is eating becomes sick or vomits the food he has
eaten, or does not feel longing for food for some time, until the blast
of the Evil Eye is warded off.&rdquo; Mr. Campbell explains this on the
principle that &ldquo;as he comes from places where three or four roads
meet, and which are spirit haunts, an evil spirit accompanies him
without entering his body, from the place of its residence by which he
has passed. If he washes his feet, the spirit goes back; but if he
enters the house with spirit-laden feet, the spirit enters the house
with him, and affects any one of the persons eating.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e335src" href="#xd21e335" name=
"xd21e335src">5</a></p>
<p>The real fact seems to be that in most cases the Evil Eye is the
result of covetousness.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e340src" href=
"#xd21e340" name="xd21e340src">6</a> Thus, a man blind of an eye, no
matter how well-disposed he may be, is almost certain to envy a person
blessed with a peculiarly good pair of eyes. But if the blind
man&rsquo;s attention be distracted by something conspicuous in the
appearance of the other, such as lampblack on his eyelids, a mole, or a
scar, the feeling of dissatisfaction, which is fatal to the complete
effect of the envious glance, is certain to arise. This theory that the
glance may be neutralized or avoided by some blot or imperfection is
the basis of many of the popular remedies or prophylactics invented
with the object of averting its influence.</p>
<p>Hence comes the device of making an intentional blot in anything one
values, so that the glance of the Evil Eye may be deprived of its
complete satisfaction. Thus, most people put lampblack on the eyes of
their children as a protection against fascination, because black is a
colour hateful to evil spirits; it has the additional advantage of
protecting the eye from the fierce heat of the Indian summer. Women
when delivery approaches often mark themselves with black <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>to avert the
demon who causes protracted labour. It is also believed that a person
whose eyelids are encircled with lampblack is incapable of casting the
Evil Eye himself; and it is considered nice in a woman to ornament
herself in this way, since because she herself, except at some crisis
of her life, such as marriage or parturition, is not liable to
fascination, it shows her indisposition to covet the beauty of others,
with the inference that she has no cause to do so.</p>
<p>On the same principle, when a parent has lost a child by any disease
which, as is usually the case, can be attributed to fascination or
other demoniacal influence, it is a common practice to call the next
baby by some opprobrious name, with the intention of so depreciating it
that it may be regarded as worthless, and so protected from the Evil
Eye of the envious. Thus a male child is called Kuriya or
&ldquo;Dunghill;&rdquo; Kadheran or Ghas&icirc;ta, &ldquo;He that has
been dragged along the ground;&rdquo; Dukhi or Dukhita, &ldquo;The
afflicted one;&rdquo; Phatingua, &ldquo;Grasshopper;&rdquo; Jhingura,
&ldquo;Cricket;&rdquo; Bh&icirc;khra or Bh&icirc;khu,
&ldquo;Beggar;&rdquo; Ghar&icirc;b, &ldquo;Poor,&rdquo; and so on. So,
a girl is called Andhr&icirc;, &ldquo;Blind;&rdquo;
T&icirc;nkauriy&acirc; or Chhahkauriy&acirc;, &ldquo;She that was sold
for three or six cowry shells;&rdquo; Dhuriy&acirc;,
&ldquo;Dusty;&rdquo; Machhiy&acirc;, &ldquo;Fly,&rdquo; and so
on.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e349src" href="#xd21e349" name=
"xd21e349src">7</a></p>
<p>All this is connected with what the Scotch call
&ldquo;fore-speaking,&rdquo; when praise beyond measure, praise
accompanied with a sort of amazement or envy, is considered likely to
be followed by disease or accident.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e355src"
href="#xd21e355" name="xd21e355src">8</a> Thus Professor Rhys writes of
the Isle of Man:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e358src" href="#xd21e358"
name="xd21e358src">9</a> &ldquo;You will never get a Manxman to say
that he is very well. He usually admits that he is
&lsquo;middling;&rsquo; and if by any chance he risks a stronger
adjective, he hastens to qualify it by saying &lsquo;now&rsquo; or
&lsquo;just now,&rsquo; with an emphasis indicative of his anxiety not
to say too much. His habits of speech point back to the time
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>when the Manx mind was dominated by the fear of
awaking malignant influences in the spirit world around him.&rdquo; So,
in Ireland, to avoid being suspected of having the Evil Eye, it is
necessary when looking at a child to say, &ldquo;God bless it!&rdquo;
and when passing a farmyard where the cows are collected for milking to
say, &ldquo;The blessing of God be on you and all your
labour!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e363src" href="#xd21e363"
name="xd21e363src">10</a></p>
<p>The same customs prevail in India. Thus, if a native gentleman
brings his child to visit a European, he dislikes to hear it praised,
unless the praise be accompanied with some pious ejaculation. And it is
safer to speak in a complimentary way of some conspicuous ornament or
piece of dress, which is always put on as a protective.</p>
<p>In connection with the question of naming, a reference may be made
to some taboos which are probably based on similar principles. A name
is part of a person in the belief of savages, and a man can be injured
through his name as well as through the parings of his nails or hair,
which are carefully looked after. Thus with all Hindus two names are
given to children, one secret and used only for ceremonial purposes,
and the other for ordinary use. The witch if she learns the real name
can work her evil charms through it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e370src"
href="#xd21e370" name="xd21e370src">11</a> Hence arises the use of many
contractions and perversions of the real name and many of the nicknames
which are generally given to children, as well as the ordinary terms of
endearment which are constantly employed. We have this name taboo
coming out in a cycle of folk-tales, such as
&ldquo;Rumpelstilzchen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tom Titty Tot,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Whuppity Stoorie.&rdquo; Here the imp or gnome has a secret name
of his own, which he thinks it impossible for any one to find out, and
he himself uses it only when he thinks he is sure to be alone.</p>
<p>This seems to be the most rational explanation of the curious taboo
according to which a Hindu woman will not <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>name her husband, or if she
wants to refer to him, does so in some indirect way as the father of
her child and so on. To this, however, there is one notable exception.
Thus, writing of Bombay, Mr. Campbell says:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e377src" href="#xd21e377" name="xd21e377src">12</a> &ldquo;At
marriages, coming of age, first pregnancy and festive days, such as the
N&acirc;gpancham&icirc; and Mangal&acirc; Gaur&icirc; in August, it is
usual for the woman to recite some couplet or verse in which the
husband&rsquo;s name occurs. At marriages this naming is, in practice,
little more than a game. An old man or an old lady gets close to the
door and refuses to allow the young women to go until they have told
their husbands&rsquo; name. At the pregnancy ceremony the same custom
is observed.&rdquo; Mr. Campbell takes this to be &ldquo;part of a
ceremony whose object is to drive to a distance any spirits whose
influence might blight the tender life of the unborn child. This seems
natural when it is remembered that the names of men are either the
names of gods, of precious stones, or of spices, all of which have a
power to scare spirits; and as repeating the thousand names of
Mah&acirc;deva is a service in which he greatly delights, apparently
because it keeps spirits at a distance, so this repeating of the
husband&rsquo;s and wife&rsquo;s name seems to have the same
object.&rdquo; The name, in other words, is kept secret on account of
its sanctity, and the custom would be based on the same rules of taboo
which have been designed among most savages for the protection of kings
and other persons of dignity from the influence of evil spirits.</p>
<p>Another mode of protecting boys from demoniacal influence is based
on the same idea of the blot of imperfection. Boys of rich parents are
often dressed in mean or filthy clothes so that they may be considered
unworthy of the malicious glance of some envious neighbour or
enemy.</p>
<p>Still another device, that of dressing up the boy during infancy as
a girl, in other words a pretended change of sex, may perhaps lead us
on the track of a possible explanation of some very curious and obscure
practices in Europe. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7"
name="pb7">7</a>]</span>We know that legends of actual change of sex
are not unknown in Indian folk-lore. Thus, we have the very primitive
legend of Id&acirc; or Il&acirc;, who was the daughter of the Manu
Vaivaswata, who prayed to Mitra and Varuna for a boy and was given a
girl. But the prayers of her father to the deities resulted in her
being changed into a man, Sudyumna. Siva changed him back again into a
woman, and she, as Il&acirc;, became the wife of Budha. In more modern
times we have the very similar story of the daughter of the Bhadauriya
R&acirc;ja. He had a daughter, who was seized by force for the seraglio
of the Emperor at Delhi, but she fled to the temple of Dev&icirc; at
Batesar and by the aid of the goddess was changed into a boy. By
another version of the tale he arranged with another R&acirc;ja that
their children should be contracted, if one chanced to be a boy and the
other a girl. Both had daughters, but the R&acirc;ja concealed the
circumstance and allowed the marriage to go on as if his child was a
son. When the fraud was detected the girl tried to commit suicide in
the Jumn&acirc;, but came out a boy, and everyone was
satisfied.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e386src" href="#xd21e386" name=
"xd21e386src">13</a></p>
<p>One explanation of the custom of pretended change of sex as shown in
the case of the Amazons, has been thus explained by Mr.
Abercromby:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e391src" href="#xd21e391" name=
"xd21e391src">14</a> &ldquo;The great desire of women, more especially
during a period of warlike barbarism, is to bear male children. Turning
our attention to the result of flattening a girl&rsquo;s breasts and
letting her wear male attire, it is obvious that a sex distinction has
been obliterated, and she has become externally assimilated to a male
youth. Moreover, the object has evidently been intentional. It would be
no outrage to the reasoning powers of the Sarmatians to suppose that
they believed a woman&rsquo;s chances of bearing male children were
vastly enhanced by her wearing a man&rsquo;s dress, and by being in
some degree conformed to the male type by forcible compression of the
breasts during maidenhood. They would argue thus: a woman wants to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>bear male children, therefore she ought to be made
as much like a man as possible. A conviction of this kind is gained by
a process identical with the immature reasoning that underlies what is
called sympathetic magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This may possibly be one explanation of the practice among
Cham&acirc;rs and other low castes in Northern India, when at marriages
boys dress up as women and perform a rude and occasionally obscene
dance. Among the Modh Br&acirc;hmans of Gujar&acirc;t, at marriages,
the bridegroom&rsquo;s maternal uncle, whose special position is almost
certainly a survival from times when descent through the mother was the
only recognized form, dresses as a Jhanda or Path&acirc;n Faq&icirc;r,
whose ghost is dangerous, in woman&rsquo;s clothes from head to waist,
and in men&rsquo;s clothes below, rubs his face with oil, daubs it with
red powder, goes with the bride and bridegroom to a place where two
roads meet (which, as we have seen, is a haunt of spirits), and stays
there till the pair offer the goddess food.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e398src" href="#xd21e398" name="xd21e398src">15</a></p>
<p>Now, there are numerous customs which have been grouped in Europe
under the name of the False Bride. Thus, among the Esthonians the false
bride is enacted by the bride&rsquo;s brother dressed in woman&rsquo;s
clothes; in Polonia by a bearded man called the Wilde Brant; in Poland,
by an old woman veiled in white, and lame; again, among the Esthonians,
by an old woman with a birch-bark crown; in Brittany, where the
substitutes are first a little girl, then the mistress of the house,
and lastly, the grandmother.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e403src" href=
"#xd21e403" name="xd21e403src">16</a></p>
<p>The supposition may then be hazarded, that in the light of the
Indian examples the object may be that some one assumes the part of the
bride in order to divert on himself from her the envious glance of the
Evil Eye. With the same object it is very common in India to bore the
noses of little boys and thus to make them resemble girls. The usual
names of Nathu or Bul&acirc;qi, the former where the ring was placed in
the side of the nose and the latter in the septum, are evidence of
this. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p>The theory of the blot of imperfection again appears in the custom
of not washing the face of a little boy till he is six years
old.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e411src" href="#xd21e411" name=
"xd21e411src">17</a> Similarly, young men, if vigorous and stout,
consider themselves very liable to the fascination of lean people, and
tie a rag round the left arm, or a blue thread round their necks, often
twisting the blue feathers of the roller bird into the thread as an
additional precaution. Nor do they care to expose their bodies to the
public gaze, but wear a light shawl of a gaudy colour, even in the
warmest season of the year. Should such a youth, if sufficiently
conceited about his personal appearance, detect a suspicious person
looking at him, he will immediately pretend to limp, or contort his
face and spasmodically grasp his ankle or his elbow as if he were in
pain, to distract and divert the attention he fears.</p>
<p>So, all natives dread being stared at, particularly by Europeans;
and you will often see a witness cast his eyes on the ground when the
magistrate looks him full in the face, sometimes because he knows he is
lying and fears the consequences, but it is often done through fear of
fascination. A European, in fact, is to the rustic a strange
inscrutable personage, gifted with many occult powers both for good and
evil, and there are numerous extraordinary legends current about him.
We shall return to this in dealing with the wonderful
Momi&acirc;&icirc; story. Here it may be noted that he has control over
the Jinn. There was a place near Dera Gh&acirc;zi Kh&acirc;n so
possessed by them that passersby were attacked. A European officer
poured a bottle of brandy on the spot and no Jinn has been seen there
ever since. A very dangerous ghost which some time ago used to infest a
road in the R&ucirc;rki Cantonment was routed in the same way by an
artilleryman, who spat on him when he came across him one dark night.
The nails of a European, like those of the R&acirc;kshasa, distil a
deadly poison, and hence he is afraid to eat with his fingers, as all
reasonable people do, and prefers to use a knife and fork. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p>A few other examples illustrating the same principle may be given
here. When a man is copying a manuscript, he will sometimes make an
intentional blot. A favourite trick is to fold the paper back before
the ink of the last line has time to dry, so as to blot and at the same
time make it appear the result of chance. We have noticed the same idea
in the case of carpet patterns. A similar irregularity is introduced in
printing chintzes and like handicrafts, and this goes a long way to
explain the occasional and almost unaccountable defects to be found in
some native work. The letter from a R&acirc;ja is spotted with gold
leaf, partly to divert fascination and partly to act as a scarer of
demons. In fact the two conceptions meet and overlap all through the
theory of these protectives.</p>
<p>Another plan is to paint up some hideous figure on the posts or arch
of the door. The figure of a Churel or the caricature of a European
with his gun is often delineated in this way. Others paint a figure of
Yamar&acirc;ja or some of the gods or saints for the same purpose, and
the regular guardian deities, like Hanum&acirc;n, Bhairon, or
Bh&icirc;m Sen, often figure on these protective frescoes. So in Italy
Mania was a most frightful spirit. &ldquo;Her frightful image used to
be hung over the doors to frighten away evil. This is quite identical
with the old Assyrian observance recorded by Lenormant of placing the
images of evil or dreaded deities in places to scare away the demons
themselves.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e422src" href="#xd21e422"
name="xd21e422src">18</a></p>
<p>Confectioners, when one of their vessels of milk is exposed to view,
put a little charcoal in it, as careful Scotch mothers do in the water
in which they wash their babies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e427src"
href="#xd21e427" name="xd21e427src">19</a> The idea is probably
connected with the use of fire as a charm. In Scotland it used to be
the practice to throw a live coal into the beer vat to avert the
influence of the fairies, and a cow&rsquo;s milk was secured against
them by a burning coal being passed across her back and under her belly
immediately after calving.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e430src" href=
"#xd21e430" name="xd21e430src">20</a> In India, if a cow gives a large
quantity of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>milk, the owner tries to hide it, and if it
chances to get sour, he attributes the loss to fascination, or the
machinations of some enemy, witch, or demon. A mother while dressing
her baby makes a black mark on its cheek, and before a man eats betel
he pinches off the corner of the leaf as a safeguard. When food is
taken to the labourer in the field, a piece of charcoal or copper coin
is placed in the basket as a preservative; and when horses while
feeding throw a little grain on the ground, it is not replaced, because
the horse is believed to do this to avoid fascination. Grooms, with the
same object, throw a dirty duster over the withers of a horse while it
is feeding, and they are the more particular to do this when it is new
moon or moonlight, when spirits are abroad. In the same way, when a man
purchases food in the open market, he throws a little into the fire,
and when a man is having a specially good dinner, he should select an
auspicious moment and do the same. The same idea accounts for various
customs of grace-giving at meals. Thus, when the Br&acirc;hmans at
P&ucirc;na begin dinner they repeat the name of Govinda; the Shenavis
say, <i>Har! Har! Mah&acirc;deva</i>, and when half finished sing
verses; the Mh&acirc;rs never eat without saying <i>Krishnarpana!</i>
or &ldquo;It is dedicated to Krishna&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e442src" href="#xd21e442" name="xd21e442src">21</a> the
Muhammadan, when he begins to eat, says,
<i>Bismillah!</i>&mdash;&ldquo;In the name of God!&rdquo; and when he
finishes he says, <i>Al-hamdulillah!</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Praise be to
God!&rdquo; Orthodox Hindus pretend that this offering of food at a
meal is a sacrifice to Annadeva, the god of food; but here many varied
beliefs, such as fear of fascination, earth and fire worship, appear to
combine to establish these and similar practices.</p>
<p>We now come to consider the various articles which are believed to
have the power of scaring spirits, and counteracting demoniacal
influence of various kinds.</p>
<p>First among these is iron. Why iron has been regarded as a scarer of
demons has been much debated. Natives of India will tell you that it is
the material out of which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href=
"#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>weapons are made, and that an armed
man should fear nothing. Others say that its virtues depend on its
black colour, which, as we shall see, is obnoxious to evil spirits. Mr.
Campbell<a class="noteref" id="xd21e457src" href="#xd21e457" name=
"xd21e457src">22</a> thinks the explanation may be that in all cases of
swooning and seizures iron is of great value, either applied in the
form of the cautery or used as a lancet to let blood. The real reason
is probably a very interesting survival of folk-thought. We know that
in many places the stone axe and arrow head of the Age of Stone are
invested with magic qualities, and Mr. Macritchie has gone so far as to
assume that the various so-called fairy houses and fairy hills which
abound in Europe are really the abodes of a primitive pigmy race, which
survive to our days as the fairies. The belief in the fairies would
thus go back to a time anterior to the use of metals, and these
supernatural beings would naturally feel an abhorrence for iron, a new
discovery and one of the greatest ever made by man. There is good
evidence in custom that the Age of Stone existed in many places up to
comparatively modern times. The Hebrews used a stone knife for
circumcision, their altars were forbidden to be hewn, and even Solomon
ordered that neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron should be
heard while his Temple was building. The same idea appears in many
cases in India. The Magahiya Doms, who are certainly one of the most
primitive races in the country, place iron under a stringent taboo, and
any Magahiya who breaks into a house with an iron implement is not only
put out of caste, but it is believed that some day or other he will
lose his eyesight. The Agariyas, the primitive iron smelters of the
Central Indian Hills, have deified iron under the form of
Loh&acirc;sura, as the Kaseras or brass-founders worship brass as
Kans&acirc;sura.</p>
<p>This idea appears in many various forms. We have already noticed the
use of iron as a charm against hail. In the same way a sword or knife
is placed in the bed of the young mother. She is, at this crisis of her
life, particularly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13"
name="pb13">13</a>]</span>exposed to the influence of evil spirits, as
the Scotch fairies are very fond of milk, and try to gratify their
desires on &ldquo;unsained&rdquo; or unchurched women.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e464src" href="#xd21e464" name="xd21e464src">23</a>
There is a case in the Indian Law Reports, where the knife thus placed
near the woman was used to murder her.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e467src" href="#xd21e467" name="xd21e467src">24</a> Pliny advises
that a piece of iron should be placed in the nest of a sitting hen to
save her eggs from the influence of thunder. This is now done in
Sicily, with the object of absorbing every noise which might be
injurious to the chickens.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e470src" href=
"#xd21e470" name="xd21e470src">25</a> So, the Indians of Canada put out
swords in a storm to frighten off the demon of thunder.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e473src" href="#xd21e473" name="xd21e473src">26</a>
The common belief is that the evil spirit is such a fool that he runs
against the sharp edge of the weapon and allows himself to be
wounded.</p>
<p>The magic sword constantly appears in folk-lore. We have Excalibur
and Balmung; in the tales of Somadeva it confers the power of making
the wearer fly through the air and renders him invincible; the snake
demon obtains from the wars of the Gods and the Asuras the magic sword
Vaiduryakanti. &ldquo;Whatever man obtains that sword will become a
chief of the Siddhas and roam about unconquered; and that sword can
only be obtained by the aid of heroes.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e478src" href="#xd21e478" name="xd21e478src">27</a></p>
<p>While a house is being built, an iron pot, or a pot painted black,
which is good enough to scare the demon, is always kept on the works,
and when it is finished the young daughter of the owner ties to the
lintel a charm, which is also used on other occasions, the principal
virtue of which consists in a small iron ring. Here is combined the
virtue of the iron and the ring, which is a sacred circle. In India
iron rings are constantly worn as an amulet against disease, as in
Ireland an iron ring on the fourth finger cures rheumatism. The
mourner, during the period of ceremonial impurity, carries a knife or a
piece of iron to drive off the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14"
href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>ghost of the dead man, and the
bridegroom in the marriage procession wears a sword as a protection; if
he cannot procure a licence from a magistrate to carry a real sword, he
gets one made of lath, which is good enough to frighten the evil
spirit. In this case he fastens an iron spike to the point. On the same
principle the blacksmith&rsquo;s anvil is used as a hail charm, and any
one who dares to sit on it is likely to be punished for the contempt by
an attack of boils. The Romans used to drive large nails into the side
posts of the door with the same object. We have already noticed the
value of iron nails for the purpose of laying the ghost of the Churel,
and such nails are in India very commonly driven into the door-post or
into the legs of the bed, with the object of resisting evil spirits.
The horse-shoe is one special form of the charm. The wild Irish, we are
told, used to hang round the necks of children the beginning of St.
John&rsquo;s Gospel, a crooked nail out of a horse-shoe, or a piece of
wolf-skin.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e485src" href="#xd21e485" name=
"xd21e485src">28</a> Why the horse-shoe should be used in this way has
been much debated. Mr. Farrer thinks it may be connected with the
respect paid to the horse in folk-lore.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e488src" href="#xd21e488" name="xd21e488src">29</a> The Irish say
that the reason is that the horse and ass were in the stall when Christ
was born, and hence are blessed for evermore.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e491src" href="#xd21e491" name="xd21e491src">30</a> The idea that
its shape connects it with the Yon&icirc; and phallicism hardly
deserves mention. One thing is clear, that the element of luck largely
enters into the matter; the shoe must have been found by chance on the
road. Mr. Leland says, &ldquo;To find and pick up anything, at once
converts it into a fetish, or insures that all will go well with it, if
we say when taking it up, &lsquo;I do not pick it
up,&rsquo;&mdash;naming the object&mdash;&lsquo;I pick up good luck,
which may never abandon me!&rsquo;<span class="corr" id="xd21e494"
title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span><a class="noteref" id="xd21e496src"
href="#xd21e496" name="xd21e496src">31</a> This, combined with the
general protective power of iron, is probably a sufficient explanation
of the practice. The custom is common in India. The great gate of the
mosque at Fatehpur S&icirc;kri is covered with them, and the practice
is general at many shrines. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href=
"#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is also a cycle of legends which connect iron with the
philosopher&rsquo;s stone and transmutation into gold. The great
Chandra Varma, who was born of the embraces of Chandrama, the Moon god,
possessed the power of converting iron into gold. Laliya, a blacksmith
of Ahmad&acirc;b&acirc;d, made an axe for a Bh&icirc;l, who returned
and complained that it would not cut. Laliya, on looking at it, found
that the blade had been turned into gold. On questioning the
Bh&icirc;l, he ascertained that he had tried to sharpen it on what
turned out to be the philosopher&rsquo;s stone. Laliya, by possession
of the stone, acquired great wealth, and was finally attacked by the
king&rsquo;s troops. At last he was obliged to throw the stone into the
Bhadar river, where it still lies, but once some iron chains were let
down into the water, and when they touched it the links were converted
into gold.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e503src" href="#xd21e503" name=

<p class="first">Gold, and in a less degree silver, have a similar
protective influence. The idea is apparently based on their scarcity
and value, and on their colour&mdash;yellow and white being obnoxious
to evil spirits. Hence a little bit of gold is put into the mouth of
the dying Hindu, and both gold and silver, combined with tigers&rsquo;
claws and similar protectives, are largely used as amulets. These
metals are particularly effective in the form of ornaments, many of
which are images of the gods, or have some mystic significance, or are
made in imitation of some sacred leaf, flower, or animal. This is one
main cause of the recklessness with which rich natives load their
children with masses of costly jewellery, though they are well aware
that the practice often leads to robbery and murder.</p>

Many of the vessels used in the daily service of the gods, such as the
Argha, with which the daily oblations are made, are made of this metal.
So with brass and various kinds of alloy used for bells, drinking and
cooking utensils.</p>
<p>The common brass Lota is always carried about by a man during the
period of mourning as a preservative against the evil spirits which
surround him until the ghost of the dead man is finally laid. Copper
rings are specially worn as an antidote to pimples and boils, while
those of iron are supposed to weaken the influence of the planet Sani
or Saturn, which is proverbially unlucky and malignant. His Evil Eye,
in particular, brings misfortune at intervals of twenty-four years; all
offerings to him are black, and consequently ill-omened, such as
sesamum, charcoal, buffaloes, and black salt; and only the Dakaut, the
lowest class of Br&acirc;hman priest, will accept such

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Next in value to these metals come coral and other
marine products, which in the case of the Hindus probably derive their
virtue from being strange to an inland-dwelling people, and as
connected with the great ocean, the final home of the sainted dead.
Coral is particularly valued in the form of a necklace by those who
cannot afford the costlier metals, and its ashes are constantly used in
various rustic remedies and stimulants. In Gujar&acirc;t a coral ring
is used to keep off the evil influence of the sun,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e529src" href="#xd21e529" name="xd21e529src">34</a> and in
Bengal mourners touch it as a form of purification. According to the
old belief in England, coral guarded off lightning, whirlwind, tempests
and storms from ships and houses, and was hung round the necks of
children to assist teething and keep off the falling sickness.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e532src" href="#xd21e532" name="xd21e532src">35</a>
So with shells, particularly the Sankha or conch shell, which is used
for oblations and is regarded as sacred to Vishnu. It is blown at his
temples when the deity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17"
name="pb17">17</a>]</span>receives his daily meal, in order to wake him
and scare off vagrant spirits, who would otherwise consume or defile
the offering. This shell, in popular belief, is the bone of the demon
Panchajana, who, according to the Vishnu Pur&acirc;na,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e537src" href="#xd21e537" name="xd21e537src">36</a>
&ldquo;lived in the form of a conch shell under the ocean. Krishna
plunged into the water, killed him, took the shell, which constituted
his bones, and afterwards used it for a horn. When sounded it fills the
demon hosts with dismay, animates the gods, and annihilates
unrighteousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All these shells appear to derive part of their virtue from the fact
that they are perforated. The cowry shell, which is worn round the neck
by children as an antidote to the Evil Eye and diabolical influence, is
supposed to have such sympathy with the wearer that it cracks when the
evil glance falls upon it, as in England coral was thought to change
colour and grow pale when its owner was sick. The cowry shell is, with
the same object, tied round the neck or pasterns of a valued horse, or
on a cow or buffalo. The shell armlet worn by Bengal women has the same
protective influence.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e542src" href=

<p class="first">Precious stones possess similar value. Sir Thomas
Brown would not deny that bezoar was antidotal, but he could not bring
himself to believe that &ldquo;sapphire is preservative against
enchantments.&rdquo; In one special combination of nine varieties,
known as the Nauratana, they are specially efficacious&mdash;the ruby
sacred to the sun, the pearl to the moon, coral to Mars, emerald to
Mercury, topaz to Jupiter, diamond to Venus, sapphire to Saturn,
amethyst to R&acirc;hu, and the cat&rsquo;s-eye to Ketu. In the
mythology the gods interrupted P&acirc;rvat&icirc; when she was with
Mah&acirc;deva, and nine jewels dropped from her anklet. When he looked
at them he saw his image reflected in each of them, and they appeared
in the form of the nine Kany&acirc;s or heavenly maidens. The Naulakha
or nine l&acirc;kh necklace constantly appears in Indian folk-lore.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=

that &ldquo;inside the fish there is a bumble-bee, inside the bee a
tiny box, and inside the box is the wonderful nine l&acirc;kh necklace.
Put it on and I shall die.&rdquo; And in one of Somadeva&rsquo;s
stories, at the marriage, Jaya gives the bride a necklace of such a
kind that, as long as it is upon a person&rsquo;s neck, hunger, thirst,
and death cannot harm him.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e552src" href=

which light fairy-land are made.</p>
<p>Many of the precious stones have tales and qualities of their own.
Once upon a time a holy man came and settled at Panna who had a diamond
as large as a cart-wheel. The R&acirc;ja, hearing of this, tried to
take it by force, but the saint hid it in the ground out of his way. He
told the R&acirc;ja that the diamond wheel could not leave his
dominions, and that no one could ever find it. The Muhammadans say that
all the diamonds found since, in these famous mines, were fragments of
the wheel.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e557src" href="#xd21e557" name=
"xd21e557src">39</a> The wearing of a ring of sapphire, sacred to Sani
or Saturn, is supposed to turn out lucky or unlucky, according to
circumstances. For this reason, the wearer tries it for three days,
that is, he wears it on Saturday, which is sacred to Saturn, and keeps
it on till Tuesday. During this time, if no mishap befalls him, he
continues to wear it during the period when the planet&rsquo;s
influence is unfavourable; but should any mishap befall him during the
three days, he gives the ring to a Br&acirc;hman.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e560src" href="#xd21e560" name="xd21e560src">40</a> The amethyst
obtains its name because any one who wears it cannot be affected by
wine. The turquoise or F&icirc;roza is a mystic stone in India. If you
bathe wearing a turquoise, the water touched by it protects the wearer
from boils, and snakes will not approach him.<a class="noteref" id=

efficacy of beads is at the basis of the use of rosaries, which, as
used in Europe, are almost certainly of Eastern origin, imported in the
Middle Ages in imitation of those worn by Buddhistic or Hindu ascetics,
who ascribe to them manifold virtue. Such are those of the Tulas&icirc;

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Blood is naturally closely connected with life.
&ldquo;The flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof,
shall ye not eat.&rdquo; Hence blood comes to be a scarer of demons. In
Scott&rsquo;s Lay the wizard&rsquo;s book would not open till he
smeared the cover with the Borderer&rsquo;s curdled gore. In
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=

dead animal is a very common method of appeasing the spirits of
disease,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e590src" href="#xd21e590" name=
"xd21e590src">45</a> and the blood sacrifices so prevalent all over the
world are performed with the same object. A curious Evil Eye charm is
recorded from Allah&acirc;b&acirc;d. A woman of the Cham&acirc;r or
carrier caste gave birth to a dead child. Thinking that this was due to
fascination, she put a piece of the cloth used at her confinement down
a well, having previously enclosed in it two leaves of betel, some
cloves, and a piece of the castor-oil plant.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e593src" href="#xd21e593" name="xd21e593src">46</a> Here we have,
first, a case of well-worship; secondly, the use of betel, cloves, and
the castor-oil plant, all scarers of evil spirits; and thirdly, an
instance of the use of blood for the same purpose. We have elsewhere
noticed the special character attached to menstrual or parturition
blood. But blood itself is most effectual against demoniacal influence.
There are many cases where blood is rubbed on the body as an antidote
to disease. In Bombay some Marh&acirc;tas give warmed goat&rsquo;s
blood in cases of piles, and in typhus, or red discoloration of the
skin with blotches, the patient is cured by killing a cock and rubbing
the sick man with the blood. Others use the blood of the great lizard
in cases of snake-bite.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e596src" href=
"#xd21e596" name="xd21e596src">47</a> A bath of the blood of children
was once ordered for the Emperor Constantine, and because he, moved by
the tears of the parents, refused to take it, his extraordinary
humanity was rewarded by a miraculous cure.</p>
<p>Similarly, among the Dr&acirc;vidians, the Kos drink the blood of
the sacrificial bull; the Malers cure demoniacs by giving the blood of
a sacrificed buffalo; the Pahariyas, in time of epidemics, set up a
pair of posts and a cross beam, and hang on it a vessel of
blood.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e601src" href="#xd21e601" name=

<p>We shall meet with instances of the same rite when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>dealing
with the blood covenant and human sacrifice. On the same analogy many

<p class="first">Similarly, incense is largely used in religious rites,
partly to please with the sweet savour the deity which is being
worshipped, and partly to drive away demons who would steal or defile
the offerings. Bad smells repel evil spirits, and this is probably why
assaf&oelig;tida is given to a woman after her delivery. In Ireland, if
a child be sick, they take a piece of the cloth worn by the person
supposed to have overlooked the infant and burn it near him. If he
sneezes, he expels the spirit and the spell is broken, or the cloth is
burned to ashes and given to the patient, while his forehead is rubbed
with spittle. In Northern India, if a child be sick, a little bran,
pounded chillies, mustard, and sometimes the eyelashes of the child are
passed round its head and burned. If the burning mixture does not smell
very badly, which it is needless to say is hardly ever the case, it is
a sign that the child is still under the evil influence; if the odour
be abominable, that the attack has been obviated.<a class="noteref" id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have just met with an instance of the use of
spittle for the scaring of the disease demon or the Evil Eye. This is a
very common form of charm for this purpose. In one of the Italian
charms the performer is directed to spit behind himself thrice and not
to look back. In another, &ldquo;if your eyes pain you, you must take
the saliva of a woman who has given birth only to boys, not girls. And
she must have abstained from sexual union and stimulating food for
three days. Then, if her saliva be bright and clear, anoint your eyes
with it and they will be cured.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e632src" href="#xd21e632" name="xd21e632src">52</a> At
Innisboffin, in Ireland, when the old women meet a baby out with its
nurse they spit on the ground all round it to keep fairies from it. In
Wicklow they spit on a child for good luck the first day it is brought
out after birth.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e635src" href="#xd21e635"
name="xd21e635src">53</a> In several of the European folk-tales we find
that spittle has the power of speech. The habit of spitting on the
handsell or first money taken in the morning is common. It is done
&ldquo;either to render it tenacious that it may remain with them and
not vanish away like a fairy gift, or else to render it propitious and
lucky, that it may draw more money to it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e638src" href="#xd21e638" name="xd21e638src">54</a> Muhammad
advised that when the demon Khanzab interrupted any one at his prayers,
he was to spit over his left shoulder three times.</p>
<p>In India, spittle is regarded as impure. Hence a native cleans his
teeth daily with a fresh twig of the N&icirc;m tree, and regards the
European&rsquo;s use of the same tooth-brush day after day as one of
the numerous extraordinary impurities which we permit. Hence, too, the
practice of spitting when any one who is feared or detested passes by.
When women see a falling star they spit three times to scare the demon.
In Bombay, spittle, especially fasting spittle, is used to rub on
wounds as a remedy. It cures inflammation of the eyes, an idea which
was familiar to the Jews. It guards children against the Evil Eye. In
the Konkan, when a person is affected by the Evil Eye, salt and mustard
are waved round <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=

spit. In Gujar&acirc;t, when an orthodox Shiah Musalm&acirc;n travels

<p class="first">We have seen above that salt is also used in the same
way. Salt, apparently from its power of checking decay, is regarded as
possessing mystical powers. All over Europe the spilling of salt in the
direction of a person was considered ominous. &ldquo;It was held to
indicate that something had already happened to one of the family, or
was about to befall the person spilling it, and also to denote the
rupture of friendship.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e656src" href=

salt on a corpse with the object of driving off evil spirits is common
in Great Britain. We have already seen that salt is given to children
after they have eaten sweets. Many classes of Hindu ascetics bury their
dead in salt. It is waved round the head of the bride and bridegroom,
and buried near the house door as a charm. In classical antiquity it

the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=

fluttering in the air round a person&rsquo;s head. Hence a long series
of customs known as Parachhan, performed at Hindu marriages in Upper
India, when lights, a brass tray, grain, and household implements like
the rice pounder or grindstone are waved round the head of the married
pair as a protective. In Somadeva&rsquo;s tale of Bhunandana we find
that he &ldquo;performs the ceremony of averting evil spirits from all
quarters by waving the hand over the head.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

perhaps one explanation of the use of flags at temples and village
shrines, though in some cases they appear to be used as a perch, on
which the deity sits when he makes his periodical visits. Hence, too,
feathers have a mystic significance, though in some cases, as in those
of the peacock and jay, the colour is the important part. Hence the
waving of the fan and Chaur&icirc; over the head of the great man and
the use of the umbrella as a symbol of royalty. A woman carrying her
child on her return from a strange village, lest she should bring the
influence of some foreign evil spirit back with her, will, before
entering her own homestead, pass seven little stones seven times round
the head of the baby, and throw them in different directions, so as to
pass away any evil that may have been contracted. When a sorcerer is
called in to attend a case attributed to demoniacal possession, he
whisks the patient with a branch of the N&icirc;m, Mad&acirc;r, or
Camel thorn, all of which are more or less sacred trees and have
acquired a reputation as preservatives. When this is completed, the
aspersion of the afflicted one, be he man or beast, with some water
from the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, in which iron has been repeatedly
plunged and has bestowed additional efficacy upon it, usually

curious survival from the time of the early handicrafts and the
substitution of weapons of iron for those of stone.<a class="noteref"

In all the mythologies the idea is widespread that the art of smithing
was first discovered and practised by supernatural personages. We see
this through the whole range of folk-lore, from the Cyclopes to Wayland
Smith, who finally came to be connected with the Devil of

<h3 class="main">Water.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have already referred to water as a protective
against the influence of evil spirits. We see this principle in the
rite of ceremonial bathing as a propitiation for sin. It also appears
in the use of water which has been blown upon by a holy man as a remedy
for spirit possession. Among many menial tribes in the North-Western
Provinces with the same object the bride is washed in the water in
which the bridegroom has already taken his wedding bath. Again, on a
lucky day fixed by the Pandit the rite of Nah&acirc;wan or ceremonial
bathing is performed for the protection of the young mother and her
child two or three days after her confinement. Both of them are bathed
in a decoction of the leaves of the N&icirc;m tree. Then a handful of
the seeds of mustard and dill are waved round the mother&rsquo;s head
and thrown into a vessel containing fire. When the seeds are consumed
the cup is upset, and the mother breaks it with her own foot. Next she
sits with grain in her hand, while the household brass tray is beaten
to scare demons and the midwife throws the child into the air. All this
takes place in the open air in the courtyard of the house. Here we have
a series of antidotes to demoniacal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26"
href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>possession, the purport of which
will be easily understood on principles which have been already
explained.</p>

<h3 class="main">Grain.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With this use of grain we meet with another valuable
antidote. We have it in Great Britain in the rule that &ldquo;the
English, when the bride comes from church, are wont to cast wheat upon
her head.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e712src" href="#xd21e712"
name="xd21e712src">61</a> It survives in our custom of throwing rice
over the wedded pair when they start on the honeymoon. On the analogy
of other races one object of the rite would seem to be to keep in the
soul which is likely to depart at such a crisis in life as marriage.
Thus, &ldquo;in Celebes they think that a bridegroom&rsquo;s soul is
apt to fly away at marriage, so coloured rice is scattered over him to
induce it to stay. And, in general, at festivals in South Celebes rice
is strewed on the head of the person in whose honour the festival is
held, with the object of retaining his soul, which at such times is in
especial danger of being lured away by envious demons.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e715src" href="#xd21e715" name=
"xd21e715src">62</a></p>
<p>This rite appears widely in Indian marriage customs. Among the
Mh&acirc;rs of Kh&acirc;ndesh, on the bridegroom approaching the
bride&rsquo;s house, a piece of bread is waved round his head and
thrown away.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e720src" href="#xd21e720" name=
"xd21e720src">63</a> In a Kunbi&rsquo;s wedding a ball of rice is waved
round the boy&rsquo;s head and thrown away, and at the lucky moment
grains of rice are thrown over the couple. Among the Telang
Nh&acirc;vis of Bijaypur the chief marriage rite is that the priest
throws rice over the boy and girl. The grain acquires special efficacy
if it be either parched, and thus purified by fire, or if it be stained
in some lucky or demon-scaring colour.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e723src" href="#xd21e723" name="xd21e723src">64</a> Thus, in Upper
India grain parched with a special rite is thrown over the pair as they
revolve round the marriage shed, and this function is, if possible,
performed by the brother of the bride. Rice stained yellow with
turmeric is very often used for this purpose. Another device is to make
a pile of rice, with a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27"
name="pb27">27</a>]</span>knot of turmeric and a copper coin concealed
in it. This at a particular stage of the service the bride knocks down
with her foot. The Lodhis of the Dakkhin, in the same way, put a pile
of rice at the door of the boy&rsquo;s house, which he upsets with his
foot. All through Northern India the exorciser shakes grain in a fan,
which is, as we shall see, a potent fetish, and by the number of grains
which remain in the interstices calculates which particular ghost is
worrying the patient. On the same principle the Or&acirc;ons put rice
in the mouth of the corpse, and the Koiris, when they marry, walk round
a pile of water-pots and scatter rice on the ground.<a class="noteref"

the death or birth impurity the house is carefully plastered with a
mixture of cowdung and clay. No cooking place is pure without it, and
the corpse is cremated with cakes of cowdung fuel. Even the urine of
the cow is valued as a medicine and a purificant. The cow guards the
house from evil, and every rich man keeps a cow so that his glance may

<h3 class="main">Colours.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Colours, again, are scarers of evil spirits. They
particularly dread yellow, black, red, and white. The belief in the
efficacy of yellow accounts for the use of turmeric in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>domestic
ritual.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e780src" href="#xd21e780" name=
"xd21e780src">70</a> A few days before the marriage rites commence the
bride and bridegroom are anointed with a mixture of oil and turmeric
known as Abtan. The bride assumes a robe dyed in turmeric, which she
wears until the wedding. The marriage letter of invitation is coloured
with turmeric, and splashes of it are made on the wall and worshipped
by the married pair. In the old times the woman who performed
Sat&icirc;, and nowadays married women who die, are taken to the pyre
wrapped in a shroud dyed with turmeric. The corpse is very often
smeared with turmeric before cremation, a custom which is not peculiar
to the so-called Aryan Hindus, because it prevails among the
Th&acirc;rus, one of the most primitive tribes of the
sub-Him&acirc;layan forests. The same principle probably explains the
use of yellow clothes by certain classes of ascetics, and of Chandan or
sandal-wood in making caste marks and for various ceremonial
purposes.</p>
<p>Yellow and red are the usual colours of marriage garments, and the
parting of the bride&rsquo;s hair is stained with vermilion, though
here the practice is probably based on the symbolical belief in the
Blood Covenant. The same idea is probably the explanation of the
flinging of red powder and water coloured with turmeric at the
Hol&icirc; or spring festival.</p>
<p>Black, again, is feared by evil spirits, and the husbandman hangs a
black pot in his field to scare spirits and evade the Evil Eye, and
young women and children have their eyelids marked with lampblack. In
the Mirzapur Baiga&rsquo;s sacrifice the black fowl or the black goat
is the favourite victim, and charcoal is valued, some put into the milk
as a preservative and some buried under the threshold to guard the
household from harm.</p>

left nostril of a woman when the pregnancy and coming <span class=

of it is worn at one stage of the Br&acirc;hman&rsquo;s life. Some of
these sacred grasses form an important ingredient in the Sr&acirc;ddha
offerings to the sacred dead, some are used in the marriage and
cremation ritual, on some the dying man is laid at the moment of
dissolution. They are potent to avert the Evil Eye, and hence the

<h3 class="main">Tattooing.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Next come special marks made on the body. Such are the
marks branded on various parts of their bodies by many classes of
ascetics, and the caste marks made in clay or ashes by most high-class
Hindus. It has been suggested that many of these marks are of
totemistic origin. That this is so among races beyond the Indian border
is almost certainly the case.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e805src" href=
"#xd21e805" name="xd21e805src">73</a> But though tattooing, a
widespread practice of the Indian people, very possibly originated in
totemism, still, as far as has hitherto been ascertained, no distinct
trace remains of a tribal tattoo, and it is safer at present to class
marks of this kind in the general category of devices to repel evil
spirits. Among purely sectarial marks we have the forehead mark of the
Saivas, composed of three curved lines like a half-moon, to which is
added a round mark on the nose; it is made with the clay of the Ganges,
or with sandal-wood, or the ashes of cowdung, the ashes being supposed
to represent the disintegrating force of the deity. The mark of the
Vaishnavas is in the form of the foot of Vishnu, and consists of two
lines rather oval drawn the whole length of the nose and carried
forward in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>straight lines across the forehead. It is
generally made with the clay of the Ganges, sometimes with the powder
of sandal-wood. The S&acirc;kta forehead mark is a small semi-circular
line between the eyebrows, with a dot in the middle.</p>
<p>The practice of tattooing is common both among the Aryan and
Dr&acirc;vidian races, but is more general among the lower than the
higher castes. Thus, the Ju&acirc;ng women tattoo themselves with three
strokes on the forehead just over the nose, and three on each of the
temples. They attach no meaning to the marks, have no ceremony in
adopting them, and are ignorant of the origin of the practice. The
Khariya women make three parallel marks on the forehead, the outer
lines terminating at the ends in a crook, and two on each temple. The
Ho women tattoo themselves in the form of an arrow, which they regard
as their national emblem. The Birhor women tattoo their chests, arms,
and ankles, but not their faces. The Or&acirc;on women have three marks
on the brow and two on each temple. The young men burn marks on their
fore-arms as part of the ordeal ceremony; girls, when adult, or nearly
so, have themselves tattooed on the arms and back. The Kis&acirc;n
women have no such marks; if a female of the tribe indulges herself in
the vanity of having herself tattooed, she is at once turned adrift as
having degraded herself. Here we may have some faint indications of a
tribal tattoo, but among most of the tribes which practise the custom
it has become purely protective or ornamental.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e812src" href="#xd21e812" name="xd21e812src">74</a></p>
<p>Among the Dr&acirc;vidian tribes of the North-Western Provinces
tattooing generally prevails. The Korwas and many other of these tribes
get their women tattooed by a woman of the B&acirc;di sub-division of
Nats. They are tattooed only on the breast and arms, not on the thighs.
There are no ceremonies connected with it, nor any special pattern. Any
girl gets herself tattooed in any figure she approves for a small sum.
Well-to-do women always get it done; but if a woman is not tatooed, it
is not considered unlucky. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32"
href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>men of the tribe are not
tattooed. The Ghasiya women tattoo themselves on the breasts, arms,
thighs, and feet. They say that when a woman dies who is not tattooed,
the Great Lord Parameswar is displeased and turns her out of heaven, or
has her branded with the thorn of the acacia. In the same way among the
Cham&acirc;rs, when a woman who has not been tattooed dies, Parameswar
asks her where are the marks and signs which she ought to possess to
show that she had lived in the world. If she cannot show them, she will
in her next birth be re-born as a Bh&ucirc;tn&icirc;, Pretn&icirc;, or
R&acirc;kshas&icirc;.</p>
<p>At present among low-caste women the process of tattooing is
regarded as a species of initiation, and usually marks the attainment
of puberty. It thus corresponds with the rite of ear-piercing among
males. To the east of the North-West Provinces a girl is not allowed to
cook until she is tattooed with a mark representing the
S&icirc;t&acirc; k&icirc; Raso&icirc; or cook-house of
S&icirc;t&acirc;, and in Bengal high-caste people will not drink from
the hands of a girl who does not wear the Ullikh&icirc; or star-shaped
tattoo mark between her eyebrows. A Cham&acirc;r woman who is not
tattooed at marriage will not, it is believed, see her father and
mother in the next world. This reminds us of the idea prevalent in
Fiji, that women who are not tattooed are liable to special punishment
in the land of the dead.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e821src" href=
"#xd21e821" name="xd21e821src">75</a> In Bombay the custom has been
provided with a Br&acirc;hmanical legend. One day Lakshm&icirc;, the
wife of Vishnu, told her husband that whenever he went out on business
or to visit his devotees she became frightened. Hearing this, Vishnu
took his weapons and stamped them on her body, saying that the marks of
his weapons would save her from evil.</p>
<p>Hence women in Bombay tattoo themselves with the figures of the
lotus, conch shell, and discus, and from this the present custom is
said to have originated.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e826src" href=
"#xd21e826" name="xd21e826src">76</a></p>
<p>In Upper India the forms of the tattoo marks fall into <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>various
classes. Some are rude or conventionalized representations of animals,
plants, and flowers. The operators carry round with them sketches of
the different kinds of ornament, and the girl selects these according
to taste. The peacock, the horse, the serpent, the scorpion, tortoise,
centipede, appear constantly in various forms. Others, again, are
representations of jewellery actually worn&mdash;necklaces, bracelets,
armlets, or rings. Others, again, are purely religious, such as the
trident or matted hair of Siva, the weapons of Vishnu, and the cooking
house of S&icirc;t&acirc;, the type of wifely virtue. Some of these
marks were probably of totemistic origin, but they have now become
merely ornamentative, as was the case in Central Asia in the time of
Marco Polo, where they were regarded only as &ldquo;a piece of elegance
or a sign of gentility,&rdquo; and among the Thracians, as described by
Herodotus.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e833src" href="#xd21e833" name=
"xd21e833src">77</a> It may be noticed that in the time of Marco Polo
people used to go from Upper India to Zayton in China to be
tattooed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e836src" href="#xd21e836" name=
"xd21e836src">78</a> These animal forms of tattooing are found also
among the Dr&acirc;vidian tribes of the Central Provinces, where the
forms used are a peacock, an antelope, or a dagger, and the marks are
made on the back of the thighs and legs. In Bengal tattooing is used as
a cure for goitre.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e841src" href="#xd21e841"
name="xd21e841src">79</a></p>
<p>We may close this long catalogue of devices intended to scare
spirits, with a number of miscellaneous examples.</p>
<p>It seems to be a well-established principle that evil spirits fear
leather. On this is perhaps based the idea of the shoe being a mode of
repelling the Evil Eye and the influence of demons. We find this
constantly appearing in the folk-lore of the West. Thus, the
Highlanders paid particular attention to the leaving of the
bridegroom&rsquo;s left shoe without buckle or latchet, to prevent the
secret influences of witches on the wedding night.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e848src" href="#xd21e848" name="xd21e848src">80</a> And
Hudibras tells how&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href=

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Augustus having by oversight</p>
<p class="line">Put on his left shoe &rsquo;fore his right,</p>
<p class="line">Had like to have been slain that day</p>
<p class="line">By soldiers mutinying for pay.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Maidens in Europe ascertain whether they will be
married and who will be their future husbands by throwing the slipper
at the new year. The throwing of old shoes at an English wedding seems
on the same principle to be based on the idea of scaring the demon of
barrenness. According to Mr. Hartland,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e863src" href="#xd21e863" name="xd21e863src">81</a> the gipsies of
Transylvania throw old shoes and boots on a newly married pair when
they enter their tent, expressly to enhance the fertility of the
union.</p>
<p>In the same way in India, people who are too poor to afford another
protective place on the top of their houses a shoe heel upwards. This
seems to give some additional efficacy to the charm, because we find
the same rule in force elsewhere. Thus, in Cornwall, a slipper with the
point turned up placed near the bed cures cramp.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e869src" href="#xd21e869" name="xd21e869src">82</a> In P&ucirc;na,
if a man feels that he has been struck by an incantation, he at once
takes hold of an upturned shoe.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e872src"
href="#xd21e872" name="xd21e872src">83</a></p>
<p>The fear which spirits feel for leather is also illustrated by the
procedure of the Dr&acirc;vidian Baiga, who flagellates people
suffering from demoniacal possession with a tawse or leathern strap. In
the Dakkhin a person troubled with nightmare sleeps with a shoe under
his pillow, and an exorcist frightens evil spirits by threatening to
make them drink water from a tanner&rsquo;s well. We shall see that
this is one way of punishing and repelling the power of witches. The
P&ucirc;na Kunbis believe that a drink of water from a tanner&rsquo;s
hand destroys the power of a witch. In the Panj&acirc;b, if a man sits
on a currier&rsquo;s stone, he gets boils.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e877src" href="#xd21e877" name="xd21e877src">84</a> The same
principle probably accounts for much of the fear or contempt generally
felt in India regarding shoe-beating as a form of punishment. At the
same time it is said in Persia and Arabia that the dread of a
flagellation with the slipper is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35"
href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>based on the idea that while a
flogging with the regular scourge involves little discredit, a beating
with anything not originally intended for the purpose, such as a shoe
or knotted cloth, is disgraceful.</p>
<p>The same feeling for the power of leather possibly explains the use
as a seat of various kinds of skins, such as those of the tiger and
antelope, by many kinds of ascetics, and in the old ritual the wife
with her husband sat on the hide of a bull to promote the fertility of
their union.</p>

&ldquo;<i lang="fr">Si on luy presente un miror, par endardement

held before a sleeping man during a hail or thunder-storm, the storm
will cease.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e904src" href="#xd21e904" name=

"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>their
thumb rings, and the J&acirc;tn&icirc; covers her sheet with little
pieces of shining glass.</p>
<p>Pieces of horn, especially that which is said to come from the
jackal, and that of the antelope, are also efficacious. The
b&acirc;z&acirc;r Banya treasures up the gaudy labels from his cloth
bales for the same purpose. Garlands of flowers possess the same
quality, and so do various fruits, such as dates, cocoanuts,
betel-nuts, and plantains, which are placed in the lap of the bride or
pregnant woman to scare the evil spirits which cause barrenness, and
sugar is distributed at marriages. The bones of the camel are very
useful for driving off insects from a sugar-cane field, and buried
under the threshold keep ghosts out of the house. Pliny says that a
bracelet of camel&rsquo;s hair keeps off fever.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Lastly, the demon may be trapped by physical means. &ldquo;To be
delivered from witches they hang in their entries whitethorn gathered
on May Day.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e916src" href="#xd21e916"
name="xd21e916src">89</a> So, many of the menial castes in the
North-West Provinces keep a net and some thorns in the delivery room to
scare evil spirits.</p>
<p>There are certain persons who are naturally protected from the Evil
Eye and demoniacal agency, or who have control over evil spirits. Such
is a man born by the foot presentation, who can cure rheumatism and
various other diseases by merely rubbing the part affected. Men with
double thumbs are considered safe against the Evil Eye, and so is a
bald man, apparently because no one thinks it worth his while to envy
such people. According to English belief, children born after midnight
have power all through their lives of seeing the spirits of the
departed. In India, people who are born within the period of the Salono
festival in August are not only protected from, but possess the power
of casting, the Evil Eye. The same is the case of those who have
accidentally eaten ordure in childhood. We have already noticed the
mystic power of cowdung. Dung generally is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>offensive to spirits. It was believed in Europe
that horsedung placed before the house or behind the door brought good
luck.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e923src" href="#xd21e923" name=
"xd21e923src">90</a> Women who eat dung possess, as we shall see, the
power of witchcraft.</p>
<p>A man with only one eye is dreaded because he is naturally envious
of those with good sight, and he is proverbially a scoundrel. The giant
with one eye is familiar in folk-lore, and he is generally vicious and
malignant. We have the black man of Celtic folk-lore who has only one
eye and one leg.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e928src" href="#xd21e928"
name="xd21e928src">91</a> In the Irish tales Crinnaur, like the
Cyclopes, has only one eye. Sindbad in his third voyage encounters a
monster of the same kind. Laplanders have a one-eyed giant Stalo, and
in one of the modern versions of the Perseus myth there are two hags
who have only a single eye between them. The same idea appears in
Indian folk-lore. The planet Sukra is said to have only one eye. Such
was also the case with the monster Kabandha, who was killed by
R&acirc;ma, and Ar&acirc;y&icirc;, the female fiend of the Veda. The
one-eyed devil appears in one of the Kashm&icirc;r tales.<a class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Gonds have a special procedure in cases of deaths
which they believe to have occurred through fascination. The burning of
the body is postponed till it is made to point out the delinquent. The
relations solemnly call upon the corpse to do this, and the theory is
that if there has been foul play of any kind, the body on being taken
up, will force the bearers to convey it to the house of the person by
whom the spell was cast. If this be three times repeated, the owner of
the house is condemned, his property is destroyed, and he is expelled
from the neighbourhood.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e939src" href=

<h3 class="main">Amulets.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In ordinary cases most people find it advisable to
carry an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>amulet of some kind as a preservative. An amulet
is primarily a portion of a dead man or animal, by which hostile
spirits are coerced or their good offices secured.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e949src" href="#xd21e949" name="xd21e949src">94</a> The amulet,
then, in its original sense, is supposed to concentrate in itself the
virtues and powers of the man or animal of which it formed a part.
Hence the claws of the tiger, which represent in themselves the innate
strength and bravery of the animal, are greatly esteemed for this
purpose, and the sportsman, when he shoots a tiger, has to count over
the claws carefully to the coolies in charge of the dead animal, or
they will certainly misappropriate them. In the same way a portion of
the umbilical cord is placed among the clothes of the mother and infant
to avert the Evil Eye and scare the demons which are then particularly
active.</p>
<p>Mr. Ferguson may be correct in his opinion that in India, prior to
the distribution of the remains of the Buddha at Kusinagara, we have no
historical record of the worship of relics;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e954src" href="#xd21e954" name="xd21e954src">95</a> still the idea
must have prevailed widely among the Hindu races, out of whom the
votaries of the new faith were recruited. With some of these relics of
the Buddha, such as his begging bowl, which was long kept in a Dagoba
or Vih&acirc;ra erected by King Kanishka, then removed for a time to
Benares, and finally to Kandah&acirc;r, where it is now held in the
highest respect by Musalm&acirc;ns, and has accumulated round it a
cycle of legends like those connected with the Sangrail, we reach the
zone of pure fetishism.</p>
<p>Another form of amulet is a piece of metal, stone, bone, or similar
substance worn on the person, with an invocation inscribed on it to
some special god. These are very commonly used among Muhammadans. By
Hindus the &ldquo;Yantras or mystic diagrams are thought to be quite as
effective in their operation as the Mantras or spells, and, of course,
a combination of the two is held to be absolutely irresistible. An
enemy may be killed or removed to some other place, or a whole army
destroyed, or salvation and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href=
"#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>supreme felicity obtained by drawing
a six-sided or eight-sided diagram and writing a particular Mantra
underneath. If this be done with the blood of an animal killed
sacrificially in a Smas&acirc;na or place where corpses are burned, no
power in earth or heaven can resist the terrific potency of the
charm.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e961src" href="#xd21e961" name=
"xd21e961src">96</a> On the same principle Hindus head their letters
with the words <i>Sr&icirc; R&acirc;mj&icirc;!</i> &ldquo;the great
god, R&acirc;ma,&rdquo; or the figures <b>74</b>, of which one not very
probable explanation is that they represent the weight in maunds of the
gold ornaments taken from the R&acirc;jput dead at the famous siege of
Chithor.</p>
<p>The equilateral triangle is another favourite mystic sign. According
to the Christian ideas, the figure of three triangles intersected and
containing five lines, is called the pentangle of Solomon, and when it
is delineated on the body of a man, it marks the five places in which
our Saviour was wounded; it was, therefore, regarded as a <i lang=
"la">fuga demonum</i>, or a means of frightening demons.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e975src" href="#xd21e975" name="xd21e975src">97</a>
Similarly in Northern India, the equilateral triangle is regarded as a
mystic sign, and the little broadcloth bags hung round the necks of
children to avert the Evil Eye are made in this shape. The diamond
shape is also approved because it contains two equilateral triangles
base to base.</p>
<p>Another form of mystic sign is the mark of the spread hand with the
fingers extended. This is made by the women of the family on the outer
wall and round the door-post, and is considered to be particularly
efficacious. Mr. Campbell suggests that the custom is based on the
belief in the hand being a spirit entry.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e980src" href="#xd21e980" name="xd21e980src">98</a> Natives will
tell you that it is because the number five, that of the fingers, is
lucky. However this may be, the custom is very generally prevalent. The
Bloody Hand of Ulster, worn as a crest by the Baronets of one creation,
is well known.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e983src" href="#xd21e983"
name="xd21e983src">99</a> The Uchlas of P&ucirc;na strew sand on the
spot where the dead man breathed his last. They cover the spot with a
basket, which they raise next morning <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>in the hope of finding
the mark of a palm, which shows that the dead is pleased and brings
vigour on the family; and the Th&acirc;kurs on the fifth day after the
birth of a child dip a hand in red powder and water and make a mark on
the wall of the lying-in room, which they worship.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e988src" href="#xd21e988" name="xd21e988src">100</a> At the
rock-cut temple of Tilok Sendur in Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d, an annual
festival is held, and those who come to demand any special benefit,
such as health or children, mark their vow by staining their hand
dipped in red paint against the rock wall, fingers upward. If the
prayer be heard, they revisit the place and make the same mark, this
time with the fingers downward; but whether Mah&acirc;deva is not
gracious to his votaries, or whether it is that the sense of favours to
come is not keen enough after the prayer of the moment has been
granted, the hand-stamps pointing downwards are not a tenth in number
of those pointing upwards.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e991src" href=
"#xd21e991" name="xd21e991src">101</a> The stamping of the hand and
five fingers immersed in a solution of sandal-wood has always been
regarded as a peculiarly solemn mode of attesting an important
document, and it is said that Muhammad himself adopted this
practice.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e995src" href="#xd21e995" name=
"xd21e995src">102</a></p>
<p>There are numerous varieties of these protective amulets. One
purpose which they serve is the procuring of offspring. Children
naturally require special protection. Thus, the Mirzapur Korwas tie on
the necks of their children roots of various jungle plants, such as the
Siy&acirc;r Singh&icirc;, which owes its name and repute to its
resemblance to the so-called horn of the jackal. In cases of disease
the Kharw&acirc;rs wear leaves of the Bel, a sacred tree, cloves and
flowers selected by a Br&acirc;hman. In the Konkan, in order that a
child may not suffer from the Evil Eye, a necklace of marking nuts is
put round its neck.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1000src" href=
"#xd21e1000" name="xd21e1000src">103</a> The G&ucirc;jars of
Haz&acirc;ra hang the berries of the Batkar tree (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Celtis caucasia</i>) round the necks of men and animals to
protect them from the Evil Eye.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1006src"
href="#xd21e1006" name="xd21e1006src">104</a> The pious Musalm&acirc;n
inscribes on his amulet the five verses known as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>Ay&acirc;tu-l-Hifz or &ldquo;verses of
protection,&rdquo; or he makes a magic square with the letters making
up the word H&acirc;fiz, &ldquo;the protector.&rdquo; Many village
Musalm&acirc;ns use little stone or glass tablets for the same purpose.
Some have a hocus-pocus inscription purporting to be a verse of the
Qur&acirc;n in Arabic; others have the name of F&acirc;tima coupled
with that of the famous martyrs Hasan and Husain. Another amulet of a
very elaborate character is described as containing a piece of the
umbilical cord encased in metal, a tiger&rsquo;s claw, two claws of the
large horned owl turned in opposite directions, and encased in metal, a
stone known as the Athr&acirc;h&acirc; k&acirc; mank&acirc;, because it
has the property of turning eight colours according to the light in
which it is placed (probably a tourmaline or quartzose pebble), and a
special Evil Eye destroyer in the shape of a jasper or marble bead.
These five articles are necessaries, but as an extra precaution the
amulet contained some crude gold, a whorled shell, an ancient copper
coin, some ashes from the fire of a Jogi ascetic, and the five
ingredients of the sacred incense. The owner admitted that it would
have been improved had it also contained a magic square.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1011src" href="#xd21e1011" name=
"xd21e1011src">105</a> This reminds us of the necklace of amber beads
hung round the neck of Scotch children to keep off ill-luck, and the
Irish scapular, a piece of cloth on which the name of the Virgin Mary
is written on one side, and I.H.S. on the other, which are
preservatives against evil spirits. In old times in England such charms
were called Characts, and one found with a criminal contained an
invocation to the three holy kings, Gaspar, Melchior and
Balthasar.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1015src" href="#xd21e1015" name=
"xd21e1015src">106</a></p>
<p>One of the most valuable of these protectives is the magic circle,
which appears in various forms through the whole range of folk-lore.
The idea is that no evil spirit can cross the sacred line. Thus, in
Mirzapur they make a circle of grain round the circular pile of corn on
the threshing-floor to guard it from evil. Among some castes the circle
round <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>which the bride and bridegroom revolve at marriage
is guarded by a circular line of string hung on the necks of a number
of water-pots surrounding it. We have seen how the Baiga perambulates
his village and drops a line of spirits round the boundary to repel
foreign ghosts. This accounts for the stone circles which are found
both in Europe and in India, and in Ireland are considered to be the
resort of the fairies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1022src" href=
"#xd21e1022" name="xd21e1022src">107</a></p>
<p>We have constant references to the same custom in the folk-tales.
Lakshmana, in the R&acirc;m&acirc;yana, draws such a circle round
S&icirc;t&acirc; when he is obliged to leave her alone. We have many
references to the circle within which the ascetic or magician sits when
he is performing his sorceries. Thus, in the story of Nischayadatta,
the ascetics &ldquo;quickly made a great circle with ashes, and
entering into it, they lighted a fire with fuel, and all remained there
muttering a charm to protect themselves.&rdquo; In the tales of the
Vet&acirc;la, we find the mendicant under a banyan tree engaged in
making a circle, and Ksantisila makes a circle of the yellow powder of
bones, the ground within which was smeared with blood, and which had
pitchers of blood placed in the direction of the cardinal
points.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1030src" href="#xd21e1030" name=
"xd21e1030src">108</a></p>
<p>The same idea appears in the magic circle used as an ordeal, or to
compel payment of a debt. Thus, we read in Marco Polo:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1035src" href="#xd21e1035" name=
"xd21e1035src">109</a> &ldquo;If a debtor have been several times asked
by his creditor for payment and shall have put him off day by day with
promises, then if the creditor once meet the debtor and succeed in
drawing a circle round him, the latter must not pass out of this circle
until he shall have satisfied the claim, or given security for its
discharge. If he in any other case presume to pass the circle, he is
punished with death, as a transgressor against right and
justice.&rdquo; In Northern India this circle is known as a Gururu or
Gaurua, and a person who takes an oath stands within it, or takes from
inside an article which he claims. In one form of this ceremony the
circle is made on the ground with calf&rsquo;s dung <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>by an
unmarried girl, and in the centre is placed a vessel of water. If money
is in dispute, the amount claimed is placed in the water vessel by the
defendant. The narrator tells a story to prove the efficacy of the
rite:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father owed a Kalw&acirc;r one rupee and the Kalw&acirc;r
claimed five. The matter was brought before the tribal council, and the
Kalw&acirc;r swore to the five rupees upon the Gaurua. Within an hour
his boy, while playing behind the house, was carried off by a wolf. He
was rescued, but he was under the curse of the Gaurua, and shortly
after he put his finger into a rat hole, was bitten by a snake, and
died within the hour.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1042src" href=

<h3 class="main">The Ring, Bracelet, and Knotted Cord.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From the same principle arises the belief in the magic
virtue of the ring, the bracelet, and the knotted cord.</p>
<p>To begin with rings&mdash;we have in Plato the story of Gyges, who
by means of the ring of invisibility introduced himself to the wife of
Candaules, King of Lycia, murdered the latter and got possession of his
kingdom. This is like the cloak or cap which appears so constantly in
folk-lore. In the Indian tales invisibility is generally obtained by
means of a magic ointment, to which there are many parallels in Western
stories. We find also the magic ring, which, like that of
Ala-ud-d&icirc;n, when touched procures the presence and aid of the
demons. A woman&rsquo;s nose-ring in India has special respect paid to
it, and for a stranger even to mention it is a breach of
delicacy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1052src" href="#xd21e1052" name=
"xd21e1052src">111</a> It is the symbol of married happiness, and is
removed when the wearer becomes a widow. Among Muhammadans, Shiah women
remove their nose-rings during the Muharram as a sign of mourning.
There was an old habit in England of marrying by the rush ring,
&ldquo;but it was chiefly practised by designing men, for the purpose
of debauching their mistresses, who sometimes were so infatuated as to
believe that this mock <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44"
name="pb44">44</a>]</span>ceremony was a real marriage.<span class=
"corr" id="xd21e1057" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1059src" href="#xd21e1059" name=
"xd21e1059src">112</a> In the same way in India a ring of Kusa grass is
put on the finger during the most sacred rites and at marriage. The
custom appears in the folk-tales. The ring represents an imperishable
bond between the giver and the receiver, and is a symbol of the
original blood covenant, which is an important element in the belief of
all primitive people.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1062src" href=
"#xd21e1062" name="xd21e1062src">113</a></p>
<p>The idea of the magic ring constantly appears in folk-lore. Thus, we
have the ring placed in a sacred square and sprinkled with butter-milk,
which immediately gives whatever the owner demands. In one of the
Kashm&icirc;r tales the merchant&rsquo;s son speaks to the magic ring,
and immediately a beautiful house and a lovely woman with golden hair
appeared.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1067src" href="#xd21e1067" name=
"xd21e1067src">114</a> So, in the tales of Somadeva, Sridatta places a
ring on the finger of the unconscious princess and she immediately
revives; the disloyal wife here, as in the &ldquo;Arabian
Nights,&rdquo; takes a ring from each of her lovers as a
token.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1070src" href="#xd21e1070" name=
"xd21e1070src">115</a></p>
<p>The same idea attaches to the bracelet, which is in close connection
with the soul of the wearer. Such is the Chandanh&acirc;r or
sandal-wood necklace of Chandan R&acirc;ja, and Sodewa B&acirc;&icirc;
is born with a golden necklace round her neck, concerning which her
parents consulted the astrologers. They announced, &ldquo;This is no
common child; the necklace of gold about your daughter&rsquo;s neck
contains your daughter&rsquo;s soul. Let it, therefore, be guarded with
the utmost care; for if it were taken off and worn by another person,
she would die.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1075src" href=
"#xd21e1075" name="xd21e1075src">116</a> The same idea appears in the
Kashm&icirc;r tales, where Panj Ph&ucirc;l refuses to give up her
necklace, as &ldquo;it contains the secret of her life, and was a charm
to her against all dangers, sickness and trials; deprived of it she
might become sick and miserable, or be taken away from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>them and
die.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1080src" href="#xd21e1080" name=
"xd21e1080src">117</a> All this is based on the conception of the
external soul, to which reference has been already made. The M&acirc;ls
of B&icirc;rbh&ucirc;m exchange necklaces at marriages, and the
Princess Kalingasen&acirc; wears a bracelet and necklace of lotus fibre
to secure relief from the pains of love.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1083src" href="#xd21e1083" name="xd21e1083src">118</a></p>
<p>The same idea shows itself in the use of strings and knots. In
Northern India a piece of bat&rsquo;s bone is tied round the ankle as a
remedy for rheumatism, and answers to the eel-skin, which is used for
the same purpose in Europe.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1091src" href=
"#xd21e1091" name="xd21e1091src">119</a> In the Shetland Islands, to
cure a sprain, a thread of black wool with nine knots is tied on the
injured place with a metrical spell.<a class="noteref" id=

charm says: &ldquo;Take from a live hare the ankle bone, remove the

bone to the body of the sufferer, and you will see a wonderful
cure.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1097src" href="#xd21e1097"
name="xd21e1097src">121</a> In Ireland a strand of black wool is tied
round the ankle, and a charm is recited to cure a sprain; a red string
is tied round a child&rsquo;s neck in chincough and epilepsy.<a class=

butter is burnt before it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1103src" href=
"#xd21e1103" name="xd21e1103src">123</a> Similarly, a peacock&rsquo;s
feather tied on the ankle cures a wound. In the Panj&acirc;b, it is a
charm against snake-bite to smoke one of the tail feathers of the
peacock in a tobacco pipe.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1107src" href=

round the arm of his new-born infant a root of that species of grass
known as the Amard&ucirc;b or &ldquo;imperishable&rdquo; D&ucirc;b,

same way as Scotch women wear round their necks blue woollen threads or
small cords till they wean their children.<a class="noteref" id=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>have already noticed the efficacy of various
grasses as spirit scarers.</p>
<p>Lastly, the cord itself has powers in folk-lore, and we meet with
the magic cord, which, tied round the neck of the hero by a witch,
makes him turn into a ram or an ape.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1117src" href="#xd21e1117" name="xd21e1117src">126</a></p>
<p>The belief in the efficacy of the magic circle accounts for a
variety of other customs. Thus, in a family sacrifice among the Chakmas
of Bengal, round the whole sacrificial platform had been run, from the
house mother&rsquo;s distaff, a long white thread which encircled the
altar, and then carried into the house, was held at the two ends by the
good man&rsquo;s wife. Among the H&acirc;ris, at marriages, the right
hand little finger of the bridegroom&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s husband is
pierced, and a few drops of blood allowed to fall on threads of jute,
which are rolled up in a tiny pellet. This the bridegroom holds in his
hand, while the bride attempts to snatch it from him. Her success in
the attempt is considered to be a good omen of the happiness of the
marriage.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1122src" href="#xd21e1122" name=
"xd21e1122src">127</a> Here we have a survival of descent in the female
line, the blood covenant, and the magic influence of the cord all
combined.</p>
<p>Connected with this is the belief in the forming a connection by
knotting the magic string. We have the European true love-knot, an
emblem of fidelity between the pair betrothed. So in Italy interlaced
serpents and all kinds of interweaving, braiding, and interlacing cords
are valuable as protectives because they attract the eyes of
witches.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1127src" href="#xd21e1127" name=
"xd21e1127src">128</a> Thus, among the K&acirc;rans of Bengal, the
essential part of the marriage ceremony is believed to be the laying of
the bride&rsquo;s right hand in that of the bridegroom, and binding
their two hands together with a piece of string spun in a special
way.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1130src" href="#xd21e1130" name=
"xd21e1130src">129</a> This belief in the mystic power of knots is

revolve round the sacred fire. A similar belief explains the wearing of
the Jane&ucirc; or sacred thread by high-caste Hindus. The knots on it,
known as Brahma-granthi, or &ldquo;the knots of the Creator,&rdquo;
repel evil influences, and Muhammadans on their birthdays tie knots in
a cord, which is known as the S&acirc;lgirah or &ldquo;year
knot.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Face-covering.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another device to avoid fascination or other dangerous
influence is to cover the face so as to prevent the evil glance
reaching the victim for whom it is intended. Thus, at widow marriages
in Northern India, the bride and bridegroom are covered with a sheet
during the rite, probably in order to avert the envious or malignant
influence of the spirit of the woman&rsquo;s first husband. It is in
secret that the bridegroom marks the parting of the bride&rsquo;s hair
with vermilion. So in Bombay,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1146src" href=
"#xd21e1146" name="xd21e1146src">131</a> the Chitp&acirc;wan bride in
one part of the wedding service has her head covered with a piece of
broadcloth. The Ramoshis tie the ends of the bride&rsquo;s and
bridegroom&rsquo;s robes to a cloth which four men of the family hold
over them. The Dhors of P&ucirc;na put a face-cloth on the dead, which
is a general practice all over the world. The same belief is almost
certainly at the root of much of the customs of Pardah and the
seclusion of women. It is as much through fear of fascination as
modesty that women draw their sheet across the face when they meet a
stranger in the streets. We come across the same feeling in the rule by
which all doors were closed when the princess in the &ldquo;Arabian
Nights&rdquo; went to the bath, and when not long ago the Mikado of
Japan and other Eastern potentates took their walks abroad. We thus
reach by another route the cycle of Godiva legends.<a class="noteref"

<h3 class="main">Omens.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Closely connected with the class of ideas which we
have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>been discussing is the belief in omens. This
constitutes a very important branch of folk-lore both in the West and
in the East. The success of a journey or enterprise is believed in a
great measure to depend on the object which was first seen in the
morning, or observed on the road at an early period of the march. Thus,
according to Theophrastus, &ldquo;The superstitious man, if a weasel
run across his path, will not pursue his walk until some one else has
traversed the road, or until he has thrown three stones across
it.&rdquo; And Sir Thomas Brown writes: &ldquo;If an hare cross the
highway, there are few above threescore years that are not perplexed
thereat, which, notwithstanding, is but an augurial terror according to
that received expression, <i lang="la">Inauspicatum dat iter oblatus
lepus</i>. And the ground of the conceit was probably no greater than
this, that a fearful animal passing by us portended unto us something
to be feared; as upon the like consideration, the meeting of a fox
presaged some future imposture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tulasi D&acirc;s, in his R&acirc;m&acirc;yana, sums up the
favourable omens:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the left-hand side a blue-necked jay was picking up food,
as if to announce the very highest good fortune; on a fair field on the
right were a crow and a mungoose in the sight of all; a woman was seen
with a pitcher and a child; a fox showed himself winding about; and in
front a cow was suckling its calf; a herd of deer came out on the
right; a Br&acirc;hman&icirc; kite promised all success; also a
Sy&acirc;ma bird perched on a tree to the left; a man was met bearing
curds, and two learned Br&acirc;hmans with books in their
hands.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1166src" href="#xd21e1166"
name="xd21e1166src">133</a></p>
<p>The face of a Teli or oilman, perhaps from the dirt which
accompanies his business, is about the worst which can be seen in the
early morning; but, with the curious inconsistency which crops up
everywhere in phases of similar belief, that of a sweeper is lucky. His
face should be always looked at first, but on meeting a Br&acirc;hman,
the glance should start from his feet. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Thags, like all criminal tribes of the present day, were great
believers in what Dr. Tylor calls Angang or meeting omens.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1174src" href="#xd21e1174" name=
"xd21e1174src">134</a> With them, if a wolf crossed the path from right
to left it was considered a bad omen; if from right to left the import
was uncertain. The call of the wolf was considered ominous; if heard
during the day, the gang had immediately to leave the neighbourhood.
The same idea attached to a crow sitting silent on a tree, which is
curiously in contradistinction to the Roman belief&mdash;<i>Saepe
sinistra cav&acirc; praedixit ab ilice cornix</i>. It was also
considered very unlucky if a member of the gang had his turban knocked
off by accidentally touching a branch.</p>
<p>The jungle tribes have a strong belief in such omens. The Korwas of
Mirzapur abandon a journey if a jackal cross the road from the left, or
if a little bird, known as the Suiya or small parrot, calls in the same
direction. The Pat&acirc;ris and Majhw&acirc;rs return if the
N&icirc;lg&acirc;&ecirc; cross the road from the right.</p>
<p>All natives have more or less the same feeling, and scientific
treatises have been written on the subject. Mentioning a monkey in the
morning brings starvation for the rest of the day; though looking on
its face is considered lucky. Hence monkeys are commonly tied in
stables to protect horses, and an old adage says that &ldquo;the evil
of the stable is on the monkey&rsquo;s head.&rdquo; So, in Morocco the
wealthy Moors keep a wild boar in their stables, in order that the Jinn
and evil spirits may be diverted from the horses and enter into the
boar.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1184src" href="#xd21e1184" name=
"xd21e1184src">135</a> For the same reason an English groom is fond of
keeping a cat near his horses.</p>
<p>If a dog flaps its ears and shakes its head while any business is
going on, disaster is sure to follow, and people careful in such
matters will stop the work if they can. The baying of a dog indicates
death and misfortune, an idea common in British folk-lore.<a class=

<p>Even the little house lizard is, like his kinsfolk, the
&ldquo;murdering basilisks, their softest touch as smart as
lizard&rsquo;s stings,&rdquo; considered by the Beng&acirc;lis very
unlucky, and when they hear its twittering they postpone a
journey.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1201src" href="#xd21e1201" name=
"xd21e1201src">137</a></p>
<p>The hare is always a bad omen. He is a god among the Kalmucs, who
call him Sakya Muni, or the Buddha, and say that on earth he allowed
himself to be eaten by a starving man, for which gracious act he was
raised to domineer over the moon, where they profess to see him. There
are traces of the same idea in Upper India.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1206src" href="#xd21e1206" name="xd21e1206src">138</a> The sites
of many cities are said to have been founded where a hare crossed the
path of the first settler. The hare is detested by the agricultural and
fishing population of the Hebrides, and it is one of the ordinary
disguises of the witch in European folk-lore.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Black is, of course, unlucky, and if a man, when digging the
foundations of a new house, turns up a piece of charcoal, it is
advisable to change the site.</p>
<p>Owls are naturally of evil omen. Even the stout-hearted Z&acirc;lim
Sinh, the famous regent of Kota, abandoned his house because an owl
hooted on the roof.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1219src" href=
"#xd21e1219" name="xd21e1219src">140</a> The hooting of the owl is a
sign that the bird means to leave the place, and wise people would do
well to follow his example. One kind of owl, the Raghui Chiraiya,
learns people&rsquo;s names, and if any one by chance answer his call
he is sure to die.</p>
<p>To see a Dhobi, or washerman, who is associated with foul raiment,
is exceedingly dangerous. I once had a bearer who was sadly afflicted
because on tour he had to sleep in the same tent with a Dhobi. The old
man was constantly bruising his shins over the ropes and pegs, because
he was in the habit of stumbling out before dawn with his hands
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>pressed over his eyes to protect himself from the
sight of his ill-omened companion.</p>
<p>A one-eyed man is, as we have already said, very unlucky. When
Jaswant R&acirc;o Holkar lost one of his eyes, he said, &ldquo;I was
before bad enough; but now I shall be the Guru, or preceptor, of
rogues.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1228src" href="#xd21e1228"
name="xd21e1228src">141</a> I once had an office clerk afflicted in
this way, and his colleagues refused to sit in the same room with him,
because their accounts always went wrong when he looked in their
direction. When it was impossible to provide any other accommodation
for him, they insisted that he should cover the obnoxious organ with a
handkerchief when he had to work in their neighbourhood.</p>
<p>One of the last of the Anglo-Indians, who had become thoroughly
orientalized, used to insist on his valet, when he came to wake him,
holding in his hand a tray containing some milk and a gold coin, so
that his first glance on waking might fall on these lucky articles.</p>

<h3 class="main">Numbers.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are mystic qualities attached to numbers. Thus,
when Hindus have removed the ashes from a burning ground they write the
figures 49 on the spot where the corpse was cremated. The Pandits
explain this by saying that when written in Hindi the figures resemble
the conch-shell and wheel of Vishnu, or that it is an invocation to the
forty-nine winds of heaven to come and purify the ground. It is more
probably based on the idea that the number seven, as is the case all
over the world, has some mystic application. So in the folk-tales the
number three has a special application to the tests of the hero who
endures the assaults of demons or witches for three successive nights.
The idea of luck in odd numbers is universal, and the seventh son of a
seventh son is gifted with powers of healing.</p>

<h3 class="main">Lucky and Unlucky Days.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">So, there are days which are lucky and unlucky. A
Persian couplet lays down that one should not go east on Saturday and
Monday; west on Friday and Sunday; north on Tuesday and Wednesday;
south on Thursday. Even Lord Burghley advised his son to be cautious as
regards the first Monday in April, when Cain was born and Abel slain;
the second Monday in August, when Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed;
the last Monday in December, which was the birthday of Judas. Akbar
laid down that the clothes which came into his wardrobe on the first
day of the month Farward&icirc;n were unlucky.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1258src" href="#xd21e1258" name="xd21e1258src">143</a> The way
some people get over omens of this kind is to send some article ahead
of the traveller on the unlucky day, which absorbs the ill omen, which
would otherwise have fallen upon him.</p>
<p>The catalogue of superstitions of this class might be almost
indefinitely extended. The principles on which most of them depend are
clear enough. They rest on a sort of sympathetic magic. Things which
are good-looking, people who are healthy or prosperous, give favourable
omens, while those that are ugly, or of low caste, or associated with
menial or unpleasant duties, and so on, are ominous. Europeans in India
usually quite fail to realize the influence which such ideas exercise
over the minds of the people. Most of us have been struck by the almost
unaccountable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>failure of natives to attend a summons from the
Courts, to keep an appointment to meet a European officer for the
inspection of a school or market. If inquiries are made it will often
be found that some idea of this kind explains the matter.</p>
<p>Thus, Colonel Tod describes how he had a visit from M&acirc;nik
Chand. &ldquo;He looked very disconsolate and explained that he had
seven times left his tent and as often turned back, the bird of omen
having each time passed him on the adverse side; but that at length he
had determined to disregard it, as having forfeited confidence he was
indifferent to the future.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1270src"
href="#xd21e1270" name="xd21e1270src">144</a></p>
<p>The same idea of good or evil omen attaches to many places and
persons. &ldquo;Nolai was built by R&acirc;ja Nol. Its modern
appellation of Barnagar has its origin in a strange, vulgar
superstition of names of ill omen, which must not be pronounced before
the morning meal. The city is called either Nolai or Barnagar,
according to the hour at which the mention becomes
necessary.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1275src" href="#xd21e1275"
name="xd21e1275src">145</a> So with the town of Jammu in Kashm&icirc;r,
which is unlucky from its association with Yama, the god of death; with
Talw&acirc;ra in the Hoshy&acirc;rpur District, which is connected with
the sword (<i>talw&acirc;r</i>); with Rohtak, which should be called
Rustajgarh, and with numerous other places in Northern India. Thus, if
people want to speak of Bulandshahr in the morning they call it by the
old Hindi name of Unchg&acirc;nw; Bhong&acirc;nw in Mainpuri they call
Pachkosa; N&acirc;nauta in Sah&acirc;ranpur, Ph&ucirc;tashahr; Mandwa
in Fatehpur, Rotiw&acirc;la, and so on.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1281src" href="#xd21e1281" name="xd21e1281src">146</a></p>
<p>So, there is hardly a village in which it is not considered ominous
to name before breakfast some one who, from his misery, rascality, or
some other reason, is considered unlucky. In Mathura there is a tank
built by R&acirc;ja Patni Mall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should a stranger visit it in the morning and inquire of any
Hindu by whom it was constructed, he will have considerable
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>difficulty in eliciting a straightforward answer.
The R&acirc;ja, it is said, was of such a delicate constitution that he
could never at any time take more than a few morsels of the simplest
food; hence arises the belief that any one who mentions him the first
thing in the morning will, like him, have to pass the day
fasting.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1290src" href="#xd21e1290"
name="xd21e1290src">147</a> When we wonder at people suffering bondage
of this kind, we must not forget that similar beliefs prevail in our
own country. &ldquo;In Buckie there are certain family names which no
fisherman will pronounce. The ban lies particularly heavy on Ross.
Coull also bears it, but not to such a degree. The folks of that
village talk of spitting out the bad name.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1293src" href="#xd21e1293" name="xd21e1293src">148</a></p>
<p>A similar euphemistic form of expression is often used in regard to
animals. If you are civil and do not abuse the house rats, they will
not damage your goods.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1298src" href=
"#xd21e1298" name="xd21e1298src">149</a></p>
<p>The Mirzapur Pat&acirc;ris when they have to mention a monkey in the
morning, call him Hanum&acirc;n, and the bear Jatari, or &ldquo;he with
the long hair,&rdquo; or D&icirc;mkhauiya, &ldquo;he that eats white
ants.&rdquo; The Pankas call the camel Lambgh&icirc;ncha or
&ldquo;long-necked.&rdquo; &ldquo;I asked the R&acirc;ja,&rdquo; says
Gen. Sleeman, &ldquo;whether we were likely to fall in with any hares,
making use of the term Khargosh, or &lsquo;ass-eared.&rsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said the R&acirc;ja, &ldquo;if you begin
by abusing them by such a name. Call them Lambkanna or
&lsquo;long-eared,&rsquo; and you will get plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is, of course, easy to avoid the effect of evil omens by the use
of a little tact and wit, as was the case with William the Conqueror,
and there are many natives who are noted for their cleverness in this
way. Of an Eastern Sult&acirc;n it is told that, leaving his palace on
a warlike expedition, his standard touched a cluster of lamps, called
Surayya, because they resembled the Pleiades. He would have turned
back, but one of his officers said, &ldquo;My Lord! our standard has
reached the Pleiades;&rdquo; so he was relieved, advanced, and was
victorious. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=

<h3 class="main">Facilitating Departure of and Barring the Ghost.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We now come to consider the various means adopted to
facilitate the journey of the departing soul, and to prevent it from
returning as a malignant ghost to bring trouble, disease, or death on
the survivors.</p>
<p>First comes the custom of placing the dying man on the ground at the
moment of dissolution. This is done partly, as we have seen, through
some feeling of the sanctity of Mother earth and that anyone resting on
her bosom is safe from demoniacal agency, and partly that the spirit
may meet with no obstruction in its passage through the air. This last
idea prevails very generally. Thus, in Great Britain, death is believed
to be retarded and the dying person kept in a state of suffering by
having any lock closed or any bolt shut in the dwelling.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1317src" href="#xd21e1317" name=
"xd21e1317src">150</a></p>
<p>The tortures which the soul undergoes in its journey to the land of
the dead are vividly pictured in some of the sacred writings.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1322src" href="#xd21e1322" name=
"xd21e1322src">151</a> He is scorched by heat and pierced by wind and
cold, attacked by beasts of prey, stumbling through thorns and filth,
until he at last reaches the dread river Vaitaran&icirc;, which rolls
its flood of abominations between him and the other shore. So, when a
Hindu dies, a lamp made of flour is placed in his hands to light his
ghost to the realm of Yama. Devout people believe that the spirit takes
three hundred and sixty days to accomplish the journey, so an offering
of that number of lamps is made. In order, also, to help him on his
way, they feed a Br&acirc;hman every day for a year; if the deceased
was a woman, a Br&acirc;hman&icirc; is fed. The lamps are lighted
facing the south, and this is the only occasion on which this is done,
because the south is the realm of death, and no one will sleep or have
their house door opening towards that ill-omened quarter of the
sky.</p>
<p>With the same intention of aiding the spirit on his way, the
relations howl during the funeral rites, like the keeners <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>at an
Irish wake, in order to scare the evil spirits who would obstruct the
passage of the soul to its final rest.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1329src" href="#xd21e1329" name="xd21e1329src">152</a></p>
<p>Another plan is to carry out the corpse by a special way, which is
then barred up, so that it may not be able to find its way back. The
same end is attained by carrying out the corpse feet foremost. Thus
Marco Polo writes: &ldquo;Sometimes their sorcerers shall tell them
that it is not good luck to carry the corpse out by the door, so they
have to break a hole in the wall, and to draw it out that way when it
is taken to the burning.&rdquo; It is needless to say that the same
custom prevails in Great Britain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1334src"
href="#xd21e1334" name="xd21e1334src">153</a> The Banj&acirc;ras of
Kh&acirc;ndesh reverse the process. They move their huts after a death,
and make a special entrance instead of the ordinary door, which is
supposed to be polluted by the passage of the spirit of the
dead.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1340src" href="#xd21e1340" name=
"xd21e1340src">154</a> A somewhat similar custom prevails among the
Maghs of Bengal. When the friends return from the cremation ground, if
it is the master of the house who has died, the ladder leading up to
the house is thrown down, and they must effect an entrance by cutting a
hole in the back wall and so creeping up.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1343src" href="#xd21e1343" name="xd21e1343src">155</a> The theory
appears to be that the evil spirits who were on the watch for the ghost
may be lurking near the route by which the corpse was removed. We have
the same idea in the European custom of saluting a corpse which is
being carried past. Grose distinctly states that the homage was really
offered to the attendant evil spirits.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1346src" href="#xd21e1346" name="xd21e1346src">156</a> So, the
Birhors of Bengal, on the sixth day after birth, take the child out of
the house by an opening made in the wall, so as to evade the evil
spirit on the watch at the door.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1349src"
href="#xd21e1349" name="xd21e1349src">157</a></p>
<p>The most elaborate precautions are, however, devoted to barring out
the ghost and preventing its return to its former home. The first of
these consist of rules to prevent the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>breach of the curiosity
taboo. All through folk-lore we have instances of the danger of looking
back, as in the case of Lot&rsquo;s wife. One of the maxims of
Pythagoras was: &ldquo;On setting out on a journey, do not return back;
for if you do the fairies will catch you.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1356src" href="#xd21e1356" name="xd21e1356src">158</a> In one of

promises to help the Br&acirc;hman and to follow him. The Br&acirc;hman
looks back and the deity becomes a stone.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1365src" href="#xd21e1365" name="xd21e1365src">161</a> The danger
of looking back is that the person&rsquo;s soul may be detained among
the ghosts of the dead. This is the reason why Hindu mourners do not
look back when they are returning from the cremation ground, and so we
find that in Naxos it is a rule that none of the women who follow the
bier must look back, for if she do she will die on the spot, or else
one of her relations will die.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1369src"
href="#xd21e1369" name="xd21e1369src">162</a></p>
<p>Another means is to bar the return of the ghost in a physical way.
Thus, when the Aheriyas of the North-Western Provinces burn the corpse,
they fling pebbles in the direction of the pyre to prevent the spirit
accompanying them. In the Him&acirc;layas, when a man has attended the
funeral ceremonies of a relative, he takes a piece of the shroud worn
by the deceased and hangs it on some tree in the cremation ground, as
an offering to the spirits which frequent such places. On his return,
he places a thorny bush on the road wherever it is crossed by another
path, and the nearest male relative of the deceased, on seeing this,
puts a stone on it, and pressing it down with his feet, prays the
spirit of the dead man not to trouble him.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1374src" href="#xd21e1374" name="xd21e1374src">163</a> Among the
Bengal Limbus, the Phedangma attends the funeral, and delivers a brief
address to the departed spirit on the general <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>doom of
mankind and the succession of life and death, concluding with the
command to go where his fathers have gone, and not to come back to
trouble the living with dreams.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1379src"
href="#xd21e1379" name="xd21e1379src">164</a></p>
<p>Practically the same custom still prevails in Ireland. When a corpse
is carried to the grave, it is the rule for the bearers to stop
half-way while the nearest relatives build up a small monument of loose
stones, and no hand would dare to disturb this monument while the world
lasts.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1384src" href="#xd21e1384" name=
"xd21e1384src">165</a></p>
<p>In the case of the Dh&acirc;ngars and Basors, both menial tribes in
the North-Western Provinces, we come across an usage which appears to
be of a very primitive type and to be intended to secure the same
object of barring the return of the ghost. After they have buried the
corpse they return to the house of the dead man, kill a hog, and after
separating the limbs, which are cooked for the funeral feast, they bury
the trunk in the courtyard of the house, making an invocation to it as
the representative of the dead man, and ordering him to rest there in
peace and not worry his descendants. In the grave in which they bury
this they pile stones and thorns to keep the ghost down.</p>
<p>Many other mourning customs appear to be based on the same
principle. Thus, the old ritual directs that all who return from a
funeral must touch the Lingam, fire, cowdung, a grain of barley, a
grain of sesame and water&mdash;&ldquo;all,&rdquo; as Professor De
Gubernatis says, &ldquo;symbols of that fecundity which the contact
with a corpse might have destroyed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1391src" href="#xd21e1391" name="xd21e1391src">166</a> The real
motive is doubtless to get rid of the ghost, which may have accompanied
the mourners from the cremation ground. In Borneo rice is sprinkled
over them with the same object, and the Basutos who have carried a
corpse to the grave have their hands scratched with a knife and magic
stuff is rubbed into the wound to remove the ghost which may be
adhering to them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1394src" href="#xd21e1394"
name="xd21e1394src">167</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href=
"#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Upper India, among the lower Hindu castes, when the mourners
return after the ceremony, they bathe, water being a scarer of ghosts,
and at the house door they touch a stone, cowdung, iron, fire, and
water, which have been placed outside the house in readiness when the
corpse was removed. They then touch each their left ears with the
little finger of the left hand, chew leaves of the bitter N&icirc;m
tree as a sign of mourning, and, after sitting some time in silence,
disperse. Others, as the Ghasiyas, pass their feet through the smoke of
burning oil, and others merely rub their feet with oil to drive away
the ghost. The same idea of barring the return of the ghost by means of
fire is found among the Nats of K&acirc;thi&acirc;w&acirc;r, who burn
hay on the face of the corpse before cremating it, and among the
Thoris, who brand the great toe of the right foot of the
deceased.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1401src" href="#xd21e1401" name=
"xd21e1401src">168</a></p>
<p>This sitting in silence after the funeral is commonly explained
merely as a mark of sympathy for the bereaved relatives, but an
analogous custom in Ireland leads to the inference that the real reason
may be to give the ghost time to depart, and not to interrupt in any
way its progress to the spirit land. On the west coast of Ireland,
after the death no wail is allowed to be raised until three hours have
elapsed, because the sound of the crying would hinder the soul from
speaking to God when it stands before Him, and would waken up the great
dogs that are watching for the souls of the dead to devour
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1406src" href="#xd21e1406" name=
"xd21e1406src">169</a></p>
<p>We have in these rites and in the ordinary ritual some further
illustrations of the protective influence of various articles which
scare evil spirits. Thus, after the cremation the officiating
Br&acirc;hman touches fire and bathes in order to purify himself and
bar the return of the ghost; and the relative who lights the funeral
pyre keeps a piece of iron with him, and goes about with a brass
drinking vessel in his hand as a preservative against evil spirits
while the period of mourning lasts. The system of protection is exactly
the same as in the case of the young mother and her child <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>during
the period of impurity consequent on parturition. As the Hedley Kow,
the North British goblin, is peculiarly obnoxious at childbirth, so the
R&acirc;kshas&icirc; of Indian folk-lore carries off the baby if the
suitable precautions to repel her are neglected.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1413src" href="#xd21e1413" name="xd21e1413src">170</a></p>
<p>Another method of barring the ghost is to bury the dead face
downwards. This is common among sweepers of Upper India, whose ghosts,
as seen in the probable connection of the Ch&ucirc;hra and the Churel,
are always malignant. The same custom prevails among the Ch&acirc;ran
Banj&acirc;ras of Kh&acirc;ndesh. With this may be contrasted the Irish
custom of loosening the nails of the coffin before interment, in order
to facilitate the passage of the soul to heaven.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1418src" href="#xd21e1418" name="xd21e1418src">171</a></p>
<p>A more elaborate ritual is that performed by the Mangars of Bengal.
&ldquo;One of the maternal relatives of the deceased, usually the
maternal uncle, is chosen to act as priest for the occasion, and to
conduct the ritual for the propitiation of the dead. First of all he
puts in the mouth of the corpse some silver coins and some coral, which
is much prized by the Him&acirc;layan races. Then he lights a wick
soaked in clarified butter, touches the lips with fire, scatters some
parched rice about the mouth, and, lastly, covers the face with a
cloth. Two bits of wood about three feet long are set up on either side
of the grave. In the one are cut nine steps or notches, forming a
ladder for the spirit of the dead to ascend to heaven; on the other
every one present at the funeral cuts a notch to show that he has been
there. As the maternal uncle steps out of the grave, he bids a solemn
farewell to the dead and calls upon him to ascend to heaven by the
ladder prepared for him. When the earth has been filled in, the stick
notched by the funeral party is taken away to a distance and broken in
two pieces, lest by its means the dead man should do the survivors a
mischief. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>The pole used to carry the corpse is also broken
up, and the spades and ropes are left in the grave.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1425src" href="#xd21e1425" name=
"xd21e1425src">172</a></p>
<p>Among other devices to bar the return of the spirit may be noted the
custom after a death in the family of preparing a resting-place for the
ghost, until on the completion of the prescribed funeral rites it is
admitted to the company of the sainted dead. Thus, among high-caste
Hindus a jar of water is hung on a P&icirc;pal tree for the refreshment
of the spirit. The lower castes practise a more elaborate ritual. When
the obsequies are completed they plant by the bank of a tank a bunch of
grass, which the chief mourners daily water until the funeral rites are
over. In Bombay Mr. Campbell writes:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1430src" href="#xd21e1430" name="xd21e1430src">173</a>
&ldquo;With a few exceptions generally among almost all classes of
Hindus, when the dead is carried to the burning ground, on nearing the
cemetery, a small stone is picked up and applied to the eyes, chest,
and feet of the deceased. This stone is called Jivkh&acirc;da or the
spirit stone, is considered as the representative or type of the
deceased, and offerings of milk and water are given to it for ten
days.&rdquo; Further he says: &ldquo;On nearing the burning ground a
small stone is picked up, and with it the feet, nose, and chest of the
deceased are touched thrice. This stone is called Ashma, and is
considered as a type of the deceased, and to it funeral oblations are
offered for ten days. The bier is then put down, and a ceremony called
Visr&acirc;nti Sr&acirc;ddha is performed by the chief mourner, who
comes forward and offers two balls of rice, called Bh&ucirc;t or
&lsquo;spirit,&rsquo; and Khechar, or &lsquo;roamer in the sky,&rsquo;
to the deceased. A hole is dug and the balls are buried there, and the
litter is raised again on shoulders by four persons and carried to the
cemetery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same idea of barring the return of the ghost accounts for the
tombstone and cairn. British evil spirits have been secured in this
way. Mr. Henderson tells of a vicious spirit which was entombed under a
large stone for the space of ninety years and a day. Should any
luckless person sit on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62"
name="pb62">62</a>]</span>that stone, he would be unable to leave it
for ever.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1437src" href="#xd21e1437" name=
"xd21e1437src">174</a> In India, when a Ho or Munda dies, a very
substantial coffin is constructed and placed on faggots of brushwood.
The body, carefully washed and anointed with oil, is reverently laid in
this coffin, and all the clothes, ornaments, and agricultural
implements that the deceased was in the habit of using are placed with
it, and also any money that he had with him when he died. Then the lid
of the coffin is put on and the whole is burned. The bones are
collected, taken in procession to the houses of friends, and every
place where the deceased was in the habit of visiting. They are finally
buried under a large slab, and a megalithic monument is erected to the
memory of the dead. A quantity of rice is thrown into the grave with
other food.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1440src" href="#xd21e1440" name=
"xd21e1440src">175</a></p>
<p>This custom of parading the corpse also prevails in Ireland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it is the custom in most, if not all, small towns
in the south for a body to be carried, on its way to the graveyard,
round the town by the longest way to bid its last farewell to the
place. If the body be that of a murdered man, it is, if possible,
carried past the house of the murderer. In county Wicklow, if an old
church lies on the way to the grave, the body is borne round it three
times.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1447src" href="#xd21e1447"
name="xd21e1447src">176</a></p>
<p>The Korkus of Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d have a remarkable method of
laying the ghost. &ldquo;Each clan has a place in which the funeral
rite of every member of that clan must be performed; and however far
the Korku may have wandered from the original centre of his tribe, he
must return there to set his father&rsquo;s spirit to rest, and enable
it to join its own family and ancestral ghosts. In this spot a separate
stake (<i>munda</i>) is set up for every one whose rites are separately
performed, and if a poor Korku performs them for several ancestors at
once, he still puts up only one stake. It stands two or two and a half
feet above the ground, planed smooth and squared at the top; on one
side is carved at the top the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href=
"#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>likeness of the sun and moon, a
spider, and a wheat ear, and below it a figure representing the
principal person in whose honour it is put up, on horseback, with
weapons in his hands. If more than one person&rsquo;s death is being
celebrated, the rest are carved below as subordinate figures. I could
not learn that the spirits are supposed to specially haunt this grove
of stakes, or that Korkus have any dread of going near it at night; but
they are far bolder than Hindus in this respect. When the funeral rite
is to be performed, the first thing is to cut a bamboo and take out the
pith, which is to represent the bones of the deceased, unless he has
been burnt, in which case the bones themselves will have been
preserved. A chicken is then sacrificed at the grave, and all that
night the mourners watch and dance, and sing and make merry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next day they go out very early, and cut down some perfectly
unblemished tree, either teak or Sal&acirc;i, not hollow or decayed or
marked with an axe, which they cut to make the Munda stake. It is
brought home at once and fashioned by a skilful man. In the afternoon
it is carried to the place where cattle rest outside the village at
noontide, and is washed and covered with turmeric like a bridegroom,
and five chickens are sacrificed to it. It is then brought home again,
and the pith representing the bones is taken outside the village and
hung to some tree for safety during the night.&rdquo; (The idea, as we
have elsewhere seen, is more probably to allow the ghost an opportunity
of revisiting them.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the friends and relations have by this time assembled,
and this evening the chief funeral dinner is given. Next day, the whole
party set out for the place where the stakes of their clan are set up,
and after digging a hole and putting two copper coins in it, and the
bones of the deceased or the pith which represents them, they put the
stake in and fix it upright. Then they offer a goat or chickens to it,
which are presently eaten close by, and in the evening the whole party
returns home.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1462src" href=
"#xd21e1462" name="xd21e1462src">177</a></p>
<p>All this ritual, carried out by one of the most primitive
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>Indian tribes, admirably illustrates the
principles which we have been discussing. The obvious intention of the
custom is to provide a resting-place for the spirit of the dead man, so
that it may no longer be a source of danger to the survivors.</p>
<p>Similar customs prevail among other aboriginal races of the Central
Provinces. In some places they burn their dead and then erect
platforms, at the corners of which they place tall, red stones. In
other places a sort of low square mound is raised over the remains of
the deceased, at the corners of which are erected wooden posts, round
which thread is wound to complete the sacred circle, and a stone is set
up in the centre. Here offerings are presented, as in the jungle
worship of their deities, of rice and other grains, fowls or sheep. On
one occasion after the establishment of the Bhonsla or Marh&acirc;ta
Government in Gondw&acirc;na a cow was offered to the manes of a Gond;
but this having come to the notice of the authorities, the relations
were publicly whipped, and all were interdicted from doing such an act
again.</p>
<p>To persons of more than usual reputation for sanctity offerings
continue to be presented for many years after their decease. In the
District of Bhand&acirc;ra rude collections of coarse earthenware in
the form of horses may be seen, which have accumulated from year to
year on the tombs of such men.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1473src"
href="#xd21e1473" name="xd21e1473src">178</a> The Pauariyas of Chota
N&acirc;gpur bury their dead, except the bodies of their priests, which
are carried on a cot into the forests covered with leaves and branches
and kept there, the reason assigned being that if laid in the village
cemetery their ghosts become very troublesome. The bodies of people who
die of contagious disease are similarly disposed of, the fact of death
in this way being supposed to be the direct act of one of the deities
who govern plagues.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1476src" href=
"#xd21e1476" name="xd21e1476src">179</a></p>
<p>In a country where immediate burial or cremation is necessary and
habitual, we need not expect to meet many examples of the customs, of
which Mr. H. Spencer gives <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href=
"#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>examples,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1483src" href="#xd21e1483" name="xd21e1483src">180</a> of placing
the body on a platform or the like in order to secure its personal
comfort and conciliate the spirit. With the object of keeping a place
ready for the spirit, some tribes are careful to preserve the body. The
Singpoo of the north-eastern frontier keep the bodies of their dead
chiefs for several years, and the K&ucirc;kis dry the dead at a slow
fire,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1486src" href="#xd21e1486" name=
"xd21e1486src">181</a> practices which among more civilized races rise
to embalming, as among the Chinese and Egyptians. The Th&acirc;rus of
the sub-Him&acirc;layan Tar&acirc;&icirc; have a custom of placing the
corpse on the village fetish mound during the night after death, and
then the mourning goes on. The practice is perhaps intended as much to
prevent, by the sanctity of the spot on which it is placed, the spirit
from harming the survivors, as from any special desire to conciliate
it. Among all Hindus, of course, as far as exigencies of the rapid
disposal of the remains allow, it is habitual to treat the dead with
respect; corpses are carefully covered with red cloth, and removed
reverently for burial or cremation.</p>
<p>There is also among some tribes the custom of disinterring corpses
after temporary burial. Thus, the Bhotiyas of the Him&acirc;layas burn
their dead only in the month of K&acirc;rttik; those who die in the
meantime are temporarily buried and disinterred when the season for
cremation arrives. The Kathk&acirc;ris, a jungle tribe in Bombay, dig
up the corpse some time after burial and hold a wake over the ghastly
relics. They appear to do this only in the case of persons dying of
cholera or small-pox, with some idea of appeasing the deity of disease.
In parts of Oudh the custom is said still to prevail among the lower
castes during epidemics, and it has recently attracted the attention of
the sanitary officers.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1491src" href=

<h3 class="main">Mutilation a Sign of Mourning.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Perhaps the only distinct survival of the ceremonial
mutilation so common among savages as a sign of mourning, is the
shaving which is compulsory on all the clansmen who shared in the death
pollution. In the Odyssey, at the death of Antilochus, Peisistratus
says, &ldquo;This is now the only due we pay to miserable men, to cut
the hair and let the tear fall from the cheek,&rdquo; and at the burial
rites of Patroklus &ldquo;they heaped all the corpse with their hair
which they cut off and threw thereon.&rdquo; The cutting of the hair is
always a serious matter. &ldquo;Amongst the Maoris many spells were
uttered at hair-cutting; one, for example, was spoken to consecrate the
obsidian knife with which the hair was cut; another was pronounced to
avert the thunder and lightning which hair-cutting was believed to
cause.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1507src" href="#xd21e1507"
name="xd21e1507src">183</a> This ceremonial shaving is also perhaps the
only survival in Northern India of puberty initiation ceremonies. In
some cases the hair cut appears to be regarded as a sacrifice. Thus
between the ages of two and five the Bh&icirc;ls shave the heads of
their children. The child&rsquo;s aunt takes the hair in her lap, and
wrapping it in her clothes, receives a cow, buffalo, or other

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All over the world the hair is invested with
particular sanctity as embodying the strength of the owner, as in the
Samson-Delilah story. Vishnu, according to the old story, took two
hairs, a white and a black one, and these became Balar&acirc;ma and
Krishna. Many charms are worked through hair, and if a witch gets
possession of it she can work evil to the owner. An Italian charm
directs, &ldquo;When you enter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67"
href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>any city, collect before the
gate as many hairs as you will which may lie on the road, saying to
yourself that you do this to remove your headache, and bind one of the
hairs to your head.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1523src" href=
"#xd21e1523" name="xd21e1523src">185</a> The strength of Nisus lay in
his golden hair, and when it was pulled out he was killed by Minos. It
is this power of hair which possibly accounts for its preservation as a
relic of the dead in lockets and bracelets, or, as Mr. Hartland shows,
the idea at the root of these practices is that of sacramental
communion with the dead.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1526src" href=
"#xd21e1526" name="xd21e1526src">186</a></p>
<p>We have already come across instances of growing hair as a curse.
Mr. Frazer gives numerous examples of this custom among savage races,
and in the Teutonic mythology the avenger of Baldur will not cut his
hair until he has killed his enemy.</p>
<p>In the folk-tales hair is a powerful <i>deus ex machin&acirc;</i>,
human hair for choice, but any kind will answer the purpose. It is one
of the most common incidents that the hero recognizes the heroine by a
lock of her hair which floats down the stream.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>A curious instance of mutilation regarded as a charm may be quoted
from Bengal. Should a woman give birth to several stillborn children,
in succession, the popular belief is that the same child reappears on
each occasion. So, to frustrate the designs of the evil spirit that has
taken possession of the child, the nose or a portion of the ear is cut
off and the body is cast on a dunghill.</p>

<h3 class="main">Food for the Dead.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another means for conciliating the spirit of the dead
man is to lay up food for its use.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1546src"
href="#xd21e1546" name="xd21e1546src">188</a> This is intended partly
as provision for the ghost in its journey to the other world.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=

different basis for the custom. As we have seen, it is dangerous to eat
the food of fairy-land, and unless food is supplied to the wandering
ghost, it may be obliged to eat the food of the lower world and hence
be unable to return to the world of men. According to the ancient
Indian ritual it was recommended to put into the hands of the dead man
the reins of the animal killed in the funeral sacrifice, or in default
of an animal victim at least two cakes of rice or flour, so that he may
throw them to the dogs of Yama, which would otherwise bar his
passage,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1551src" href="#xd21e1551" name=

folk-tales where the hero takes some food with him which he flings to
the fierce beasts which prevent him from gaining the water of life or
whatever may have been the test imposed upon him. The use of pulse in
the funeral rites depends upon the same principle, and in the Greek
belief the dead carried vegetables with them to hell, either to win the
right of passage or as provisions for the road.</p>

<p class="first">Hence too comes the practice of burning with the
corpse the articles which the dead man was in the habit of using. They
rise with the fumes of the pyre and solace him in the world of spirits.
The Kos told Colonel Dalton that the reason of this was that they were
unwilling to derive any immediate benefit by the death of a member of
the family. Hence they burn his wearing apparel and personal effects,
but they do not destroy clothes and other things which have not been
worn. For this reason, old men of the tribe, in a spirit of careful

<p>The custom of laying out food for the ghost still prevails in
Ireland, where it is a very prevalent practice during some nights after
death to leave food outside the house, a griddle cake or a dish of
potatoes. If it is gone in the morning, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>spirits
must have taken it, for no human being would touch the food left for
the dead, as it might compel him to join their company. On November Eve
food is laid out in the same way.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1566src"
href="#xd21e1566" name="xd21e1566src">191</a></p>
<p>There are numerous examples of similar practices in India. The
Mh&acirc;rs of Kh&acirc;ndesh, when they remove a corpse, put in its
mouth a P&acirc;n leaf with a gold bead from his wife&rsquo;s necklace.
At the grave the brother or son of the dead man wets the end of his
turban and drops a little water on the lips of the corpse.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1571src" href="#xd21e1571" name=
"xd21e1571src">192</a> So the Greeks used to put a coin in the dead
man&rsquo;s mouth to enable him to pay his fare to Charon. In the
Panj&acirc;b it is a common practice to put in the mouth of the corpse
the Pancharatana or five kinds of jewels, gold, silver, copper, coral,
and pewter. The leaves of the Tulasi or sweet basil and Ganges water
are put into the mouth of a dying man, and the former into the ears and
nostrils also. They are said to be offerings to Yama, the god of death,
who on receiving them shows mercy to the soul of the deceased. The same
customs generally prevail among the Hindus of Northern India.</p>
<p>Among the Buddhists of the Him&acirc;laya, Moorcroft was present at
the consecration of the food of the dead.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1576src" href="#xd21e1576" name="xd21e1576src">193</a> The
L&acirc;ma consecrated barley and water and poured them from a silver
saucer into a brass vessel, occasionally striking two brass cymbals
together, reciting or chanting prayers, to which from time to time an
inferior L&acirc;ma uttered responses aloud, accompanied by the rest in
an undertone. This was intended for the use of the souls in hell, who
would starve were it not provided. The music and singing, if we may
apply the analogy of Indian practices, are intended to scare the
vagrant ghosts, who would otherwise consume or defile the food.</p>
<p>The same is the case among the Dr&acirc;vidian races. Thus, the
Bhuiy&acirc;rs of Mirzapur after the funeral feast throw a cupful of
oil and some food into the water hole in which the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>ashes of
the dead man are deposited. They say that he will never be hungry or
want oil to anoint himself after bathing. The Korwas, when burning a
corpse, place with it the ornaments and clothes of the deceased, and an
axe, which they do not break, as is the habit of many other savages.
They say that the spirit of the dead man will want it to hack his way
through the jungles of the lower world. When the Bhuiy&acirc;rs cremate
a corpse they throw near the spot an axe, if the deceased was a man,
and a Khurpi or weeding spud, if a woman. No one would dare to
appropriate such things, as he would be forced to join the ghastly
company of their owners. Where the corpse is burned they leave a
platter made of leaves containing a little boiled rice, and they
sprinkle on the ground all the ordinary kinds of grain and some
turmeric and salt as food for the dead in the next world.</p>
<p>All these tribes and many low-caste Hindus in Northern India lay out
platters of food under the eaves of the house during the period of
mourning, and they ascertain by peculiar marks which they examine next
day whether the spirit has partaken of the food or not. Among the
jungle tribes there is a rule that the food for the dead is prepared,
not by the house-mother, but by the senior daughter-in-law, and even if
incapacitated by illness from performing this duty, she is bound at
least to commence the work by cooking one or two cakes, the rest being
prepared by one of the junior women of the family.</p>
<p>Among the more Hinduized Majhw&acirc;rs and Pat&acirc;ris we reach
the stage where the clothes, implements of the deceased, and some food
are given to the Pat&acirc;ri priest, who, by vicariously consuming
them, lays up a store for the use of the dead man in the other world.
This is the principle on which food and other articles are given to the
Mah&acirc;br&acirc;hman or ordinary Hindu funeral priest at the close
of the period of mourning.</p>
<p>Among the Bengal tribes, the M&acirc;l Pahariyas pour the blood of
goats and fowls on their ancestral memorial pillars that the souls may
not hunger in the world of the dead. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>Among the Bh&ucirc;mij,
at the funeral ceremony, an outsider, who is often a Laiya or priest,
comes forward to personate the deceased, by whose name he is addressed,
and asked what he wants to eat. Acting thus as the dead man&rsquo;s
proxy, he mentions various articles of food, which are placed before
him. After making a regular meal, he goes away, and the spirit of the
deceased is believed to go with him. So among the Kolis of the Konkan,
the dead man&rsquo;s soul is brought back into one of the mourners.
Among the V&acirc;rlis of Th&acirc;na, on the twelfth day after death,
a dinner is given to the nearest relations, and during the night the
spirit of the dead enters into one of the relations, who entertains the
rest with the story of some event in the dead man&rsquo;s life. Among
the Sant&acirc;ls, one of the mourners drums by the ashes of the dead,
and the spirit enters the body, when the mourner shaves, bathes, eats a
cock, and drinks some liquor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1591src" href=
"#xd21e1591" name="xd21e1591src">194</a></p>
<p>Among the Bengal Chakmas, a bamboo post or other portion of a dead
man&rsquo;s house is burned with him, probably in order to provide him
with shelter in the next world. Among the K&acirc;mis, before they can
partake of the funeral feast, a small portion of every dish must be
placed in a leaf plate and taken out into the jungle for the spirit of
the dead man, and carefully watched until a fly or other insect settles
upon it. The watcher then covers up the plate with a slab of stone,
eats his own food, and returns to tell the relatives that the spirit
has received the offering prepared for him.</p>

<p class="first">But while it is expedient by some or other of these
devices to bar or lay the ghost, or prevent its return by providing for
its journey to, and accommodation in the next world, some tribes have a
custom of making arrangements to bring back the soul of the deceased to
the family abode, where he is worshipped as a household spirit. Some of
the Central Indian tribes catch the spirit re-embodied in a fowl or
fish, some bring it home in a pot of water or flour.<a class="noteref"

illustrates an idea common to all folk-lore that the ghost cannot cross
running water without material assistance. Among the Hos on the evening
of the cremation day certain preparations are made in anticipation of a
visit from the ghost. Some boiled rice is laid apart for it, and ashes
are sprinkled on the floor, in order that, should it come, its
footsteps may be detected. On returning they carefully scrutinize the
ashes and the rice, and if there is the faintest indication of these
having been disturbed, it is attributed to the action of the spirit,
and they sit down shivering with horror and crying bitterly, as if they
were by no means pleased with the visit, though it be made at their
earnest solicitation.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1630src" href=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=

the Dragon. The idea probably originally arose from the respect paid to
the ashes of the house fire by primitive races, among whom the hearth
and the kitchen are the home of the household godlings.</p>
<p>There are numerous instances of this practice from Europe. In the
Western Islands of Scotland on Candlemas Day the mistress takes a sheaf
of oats, dresses it in woman&rsquo;s apparel, and after putting it in a
large basket beside which a wooden club is placed, cries three times,
&ldquo;Briid is come! Briid is welcome!&rdquo; Next morning they look
for the impression of Briid&rsquo;s club in the ashes, which is an omen
of a good harvest.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1645src" href=

open hearth and nicely flattened down by the women before they go to
bed. In the morning they look for footmarks on the hearth, and if they
find such footmarks directed to the door, it means in the course of the
year a death in the family, and if the reverse, they expect an addition
to it by marriage.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1657src" href=
"#xd21e1657" name="xd21e1657src">203</a> According to one of the
Italian charms, &ldquo;And they were accustomed to divine sometimes
with the ashes from the sacrifices. And to this day there is a trace of
it, when that which is to be divined is written on the ashes with the
finger or with the stick. Then the ashes are stirred by the fresh
breeze, and one looks for the letters which they form by being
moved.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1661src" href="#xd21e1661"

<p>Amongst some Hindus, on the tenth night after the death of a person,
he who fired the funeral pyre is required to sift <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>some
ashes, near which a lamp is placed, and the whole covered with a

ashes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1668src" href="#xd21e1668" name=

tribes of Mirzapur spread ashes on the floor, and a mark generally like
that of a chicken&rsquo;s foot shows that the family ghosts have
visited the house. &ldquo;On New Year&rsquo;s Eve,&rdquo; says Aubrey,
&ldquo;sift or smooth the ashes and leave it so when you go to bed;
next morning look, and if you find there the likeness of a coffin, one

so-called &ldquo;food vases&rdquo; and &ldquo;drinking cups&rdquo;
found in the long barrows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1674src" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After a death all the household earthen pots are
broken and replaced. It has been suggested that this is due either to
the belief that the ghost of the dead man is in some of them, or that
the custom may have some connection with the idea of providing the
ghost with utensils in the next world.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1682src" href="#xd21e1682" name="xd21e1682src">208</a> In popular
belief, however, the custom is explained by the death pollution
attaching to all the family cooking vessels, which, if of metal, are
purified with fire. The vessel is the home of the spirit: &ldquo;At
most Hindu funerals a water jar is carried round the pyre, and then
dashed to the ground, apparently to show that the spirit has left its
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=

spirit homes large whitewashed earthen jars laid on their sides. So, to
please any spirit likely to injure a crop, an earthen jar is set on a
pole as the spirit&rsquo;s house, and so at a wedding or other
ceremonies, jars, sometimes empty, sometimes filled with water, are
piled as homes for planets and other marriage gods and goddesses, that

tale in the Arabian Nights the demon is shut up in a jar under the seal
of the Lord Solomon, as in one of the German tales the Devil is shut up
in a crevice in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76"

the Indian ghosts, like the Ifr&icirc;t of the Arabian Nights, can grow
to the length of ten yojanas or eighty miles. In one of the Bengal

several yards for a vessel.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1713src" href=
"#xd21e1713" name="xd21e1713src">213</a> Some ghosts possess the very
dangerous power of entering human corpses, like the Vet&acirc;la, and
swelling to an enormous size. The Kharw&acirc;rs of Mirzapur have a
wild legend, which tells how long ago an unmarried girl of the tribe
died, and was being cremated. While the relations were collecting wood
for the pyre, a ghost entered the corpse, but the friends managed to
expel him. Since then great care is taken not to leave the bodies of
women unwatched. So, in the Panj&acirc;b, when a great person is
cremated the bones and ashes are carefully watched till the fourth day,
to prevent a magician interfering with them. If he has a chance, he can
restore the deceased to life, and ever after retain him under his
influence. This is the origin of the custom in Great Britain of waking
the dead, a practice which &ldquo;most probably originated from a silly
superstition as to the danger of a corpse being carried off by some of
the agents of the invisible world, or exposed to the ominous liberties
of brute animals.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1716src" href=

the best course, if the corpse cannot be immediately disposed of, to
measure it carefully, and then no malignant Bh&ucirc;t can occupy it.

palanquin, he wears wooden sandals, lives in a Banyan or Bel tree, and
Sankhach&ucirc;rn&icirc; is his mistress. He appears to be about the

common Bh&ucirc;ts, frightens men, but is harmless and quiet, never

survivals from the early mythology in a sadly degraded form. As Varuna,
the god of the firmament, has been reduced in these later days to
Barun, a petty weather godling, so the J&acirc;k is the modern
representative of the Yaksha, who in better times was the attendant of
Kuvera, the god of wealth, in which duty he was assisted by the
Guhyaka. The character of the Yaksha is not very certain. He was called
Punya-janas, &ldquo;the good people,&rdquo; but he sometimes appears as
an imp of evil. In the folk-tales, it must be admitted, the Yakshas
have an equivocal reputation. In one story the female, or
Yakshin&icirc;, bewilders travellers at night, makes horns grow on
their foreheads, and finally devours them; in another the Yakshas have,
like the Churel, feet turned the wrong way and squinting eyes; in a
third they separate the hero from the heroine because he failed to make
due offerings to them on his wedding day. On the other hand, in a
fourth tale the Yakshin&icirc; is described as possessed of heavenly
beauty; she appears again when a sacrifice is made in a cemetery to get
her into the hero&rsquo;s power, as a heavenly maiden beautifully
adorned, seated in a chariot of gold surrounded by lovely girls; and
lastly, a Br&acirc;hman meets some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80"
href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>Buddhist ascetics, performs the
Uposhana vow, and would have become a god, had it not been that a
wicked man compelled him by force to take food in the evening, and so
he was re-born as a Guhyaka.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1777src" href=
"#xd21e1777" name="xd21e1777src">222</a></p>
<p>In the modern folk-lore of Kashm&icirc;r, the Yaksha has turned into
the Yech or Yach, a humorous, though powerful, sprite in the shape of a
civet cat of a dark colour, with a white cap on his head. This small
high cap is one of the marks of the Irish fairies, and the Incubones of
Italy wear caps, &ldquo;the symbols of their hidden, secret
natures.&rdquo; The feet of the Yech are so small as to be almost
invisible, and it squeaks in a feline way. It can assume any shape, and
if its white cap can be secured, it becomes the servant of the
possessor, and the white cap makes him invisible.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1785src" href="#xd21e1785" name="xd21e1785src">223</a></p>
<p>In the Vishnu Pur&acirc;na we read that Vishnu created the Yakshas
as beings emaciate with hunger, of hideous aspect, and with big beards,
and that from their habit of crying for food they were so
named.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1790src" href="#xd21e1790" name=
"xd21e1790src">224</a> By the Buddhists they were regarded as benignant
spirits. One of them acts as sort of chorus in the Meghad&ucirc;ta or
&ldquo;Cloud Messenger&rdquo; of K&acirc;lid&acirc;sa. Yet we read of
the Yaka Alawaka, who, according to the Buddhist legend, used to live
in a Banyan tree, and slay any one who approached it; while in Ceylon
they are represented as demons whom Buddha destroyed.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1799src" href="#xd21e1799" name="xd21e1799src">225</a> In
later Hinduism they are generally of fair repute, and one of them was
appointed by Indra to be the attendant of the Jaina Saint
Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra. It is curious that in Gujar&acirc;t the term
Yaksha is applied to Musalm&acirc;ns, and in Cutch to a much older race
of northern conquerors.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1802src" href=
"#xd21e1802" name="xd21e1802src">226</a></p>
<p>At any rate the modern J&acirc;k and J&acirc;kn&icirc;, Chordeva and
Chordev&icirc;, are eminently respectable and kindly sprites. They are,
in fact, an obvious survival of the pair of corn <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>spirits
which inhabit the standing crop.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1809src"
href="#xd21e1809" name="xd21e1809src">227</a> The J&acirc;k is
compelled to live apart from the J&acirc;kn&icirc; in neighbouring
villages, but he is an uxorious husband, and robs his own village to
supply the wants of his consort. So, if you see a comparatively barren
village, which is next to one more productive, you may be sure that the
J&acirc;k lives in the former and the J&acirc;kn&icirc; in the latter.
The same is the character of the Chor or Chordeva and the Chorn&icirc;
or Chordev&icirc; of the jungle tribes of Mirzapur<span class="corr"

<h3 class="main">Ghosts which Protect Cattle.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Hills there are various benevolent ghosts or
godlings who protect cattle. S&acirc;in, the spirit of an old ascetic,
helps the Bhotiyas to recover lost cattle, and Siddhua and Buddhua, the
ghosts of two harmless goatherds, are invoked when a goat falls
ill.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1820src" href="#xd21e1820" name=
"xd21e1820src">228</a> In the same class is Nagardeo of Garhw&acirc;l,
who is represented in nearly every village by a three-pronged pike or
Tris&ucirc;la on a platform. When cows and buffaloes are first milked,
the milk is offered to him. It is perhaps possible that from some
blameless godling of the cow-pen, such as Nagardeo, the cultus of
Pasupatin&acirc;tha, &ldquo;the lord of animals,&rdquo; an epithet of
Siva or Rudra, who has a stately shrine at Hardw&acirc;r, where his
lingam is wreathed with cobras, was derived. Another Hill godling of
the same class is Chaumu or Baudh&acirc;n, who has a shrine in every
village, which the people at the risk of offending him are supposed to
keep clean and holy. Lamps are lighted, sweetmeats and the fruits of
the earth are offered to him. When a calf dies the milk of the mother
is considered unholy till the twelfth day, when some is offered to the
deity. He also recovers lost animals, if duly propitiated, but if
neglected, he brings disease on the herd.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1823src" href="#xd21e1823" name="xd21e1823src">229</a></p>
<p>Another cattle godling in the Hills is Kaluva or Kalbisht, who lived
on earth some two hundred years ago. His enemies persuaded his
brother-in-law to kill him. After his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>death he became a
benevolent spirit, and the only people he injured were the enemies who
compassed his death. His name is now a charm against wild beasts, and
people who are oppressed resort to his shrine for justice. Except in
name he seems to have nothing to say to K&acirc;lu Kah&acirc;r, who was
born of a Kah&acirc;r girl, who by magical charms compelled King
Solomon to marry her. His fetish is a stick covered with
peacock&rsquo;s feathers to which offerings of food are made. He has
more than a quarter of a million worshippers, according to the last
census, in the Meerut Division.</p>

those who are merely bugaboos to frighten children. Such are Hawwa,
probably a corruption through the Pr&acirc;krit of the Sanskrit

Emperor Humay&ucirc;n, who died by an untimely death. Akin perhaps to

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The worship of trees and serpents may be conveniently
considered together; not that there is much connection between these
two classes of belief, but because this course has been followed in Mr.
Ferguson&rsquo;s elaborate monograph on the subject.</p>
<p>The worship of trees appears to be based on many converging lines of
thought, which it is not easy to disentangle. Mr. H. Spencer<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1911src" href="#xd21e1911" name="xd21e1911src">1</a>
classes it as an aberrant species of ancestor worship: &ldquo;A species
somewhat more disguised externally, but having the same internal
nature; and though it develops in three different directions, still
these have all one common origin. First, the toxic excitements produced
by certain plants are attributed to the agency of spirits or demons;
secondly, tribes that have come out of places characterized by
particular trees or plants, unawares change the legend of emergence
from them into the legend of descent from them; thirdly, the naming of
individuals after plants becomes a source of confusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Dr. Tylor,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1918src" href=
"#xd21e1918" name="xd21e1918src">2</a> again, the worship depends upon
man&rsquo;s animistic theory of nature: &ldquo;Whether such a tree
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>is looked on as inhabited by its own proper life
and soul, or as possessed like a fetish by some other spirit which has
entered it or used it for a body, is often hard to determine. The tree
may be the spirits&rsquo; perch or shelter (as we have seen in the case
of the Churel or R&acirc;kshasa), or the sacred grove is assumed to be
the spirits&rsquo; resort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Frazer has given a very careful analysis of this branch of
popular religion.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1925src" href="#xd21e1925"
name="xd21e1925src">3</a> He shows that to the savage in general the
world is animate and trees are no exception to the rule; he thinks they
have souls like his own and treats them accordingly; they are supposed
to feel injuries done to them; the souls of the dead sometimes animate
them; the tree is regarded sometimes as the body, sometimes as the home
of the tree spirit; trees and tree spirits give rain and sunshine; they
cause the crops to grow; the tree spirit makes the herds to multiply
and blesses women with offspring; the tree spirit is often conceived
and represented as detached from the tree and even as embodied in
living men and women.</p>
<p>The basis of the cultus may then perhaps be stated as follows: There
is first the tree which is regarded as embodying or representing the
spirit which influences the fertility of crops and human beings. Hence
the respect paid to memorial trees, where the people assemble, as at
the village P&icirc;pal, which is valued for its shade and beauty and
its long connection with the social life of the community. This would
naturally be regarded as the abode of some god and forms the village
shrine, a convenient centre for the religious worship of the local
deities, where they reside and accept the worship and offerings of
their votaries.</p>
<p>It may, again, be the last survival of the primitive forest, where
the dispossessed spirits of the jungle find their final and only
resting-place. Such secluded groves form the only and perhaps the
earliest shrine of many primitive races.</p>
<p>Again, an allegorical meaning would naturally be attached to various
trees. It is invested with a mystic power owing to the mysterious
waving of its leaves and branches, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>result of supernatural
agency; and this would account for the weird sounds of the forest at
night.</p>
<p>Many trees are evergreen, and thus enjoy eternal life. Every tree is
a sort of emblem of life, reproducing itself in some uncanny fashion
with each recurring spring.</p>
<p>It has some mystic connection with the three worlds&mdash;</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter xd21e1941">
<p class="line">Quantum vertice ad auras</p>
<p class="line">Aetherias tantum radice in Tartara tendit.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Like Yggdrassil, it connects the world of man with the
world of gods, and men may, like Jack of the Beanstalk, climb by its
aid to heaven. In this connection it may be noted that many Indian
tribes bury their dead in trees. The Khasiyas of East Bengal lay the
body in the hollow trunk of a tree. The N&acirc;gas dispose of their
dead in the same way, or hang them in coffins to the branches. The
M&acirc;riya Gonds tie the corpse to a tree and burn it. The Malers lay
the corpse of a priest, whose ghost often gives trouble, under a tree
and cover it with leaves.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1948src" href=
"#xd21e1948" name="xd21e1948src">4</a> Similar customs prevail among
primitive races in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>The tree embodies in itself many utilities necessary to human life,
and many qualities which menace its existence. Its wood is the source
of fire, itself a fetish. Its fruits, juices, flowers or bark are
sources of food or possess intoxicating or poisonous attributes, which
are naturally connected with demoniacal influences. Trees often develop
into curious or uncanny forms, which compel fear or adoration. Thus
according to the old ritual<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1953src" href=
"#xd21e1953" name="xd21e1953src">5</a> trees which have been struck by
lightning, or knocked down by inundation, or which have fallen in the
direction of the south, or which grew on a burning ground or
consecrated site, or at the confluence of large rivers, or by the
roadside; those which have withered tops, or an entanglement of heavy
creepers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>upon them, or are the receptacles of many
honey-combs or birds&rsquo; nests, are reckoned unfit for the
fabrication of bedsteads, as they are inauspicious and sure to bring
disease and death. The step from such beliefs to the worship of any
curious and remarkable tree is easy.</p>
<p>Hence the belief that the planting of a grove is a work of religious
merit, which is so strongly felt by Hindus, and the idea that the grove
has special religious associations, shown by the marriage of its trees
to the well, and other rites of the same kind. In the Konkan it is very
generally believed that barrenness is caused by uneasy spirits which
wander about, and that if a home be made for the spirit by planting
trees, it will go and reside there and the curse of barrenness will be
removed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1960src" href="#xd21e1960" name=
"xd21e1960src">6</a></p>
<p>Though this branch of the subject has been pushed to quite an
unreasonable length in some recent books,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1965src" href="#xd21e1965" name="xd21e1965src">7</a> there may be
some association of tree worship with the phallic cultus, such as is
found in the Asherah or &ldquo;groves&rdquo; of the Hebrews, the
European Maypole, and so on. This has been suggested as an explanation
of the honour paid by the Gypsy race in Germany to the fir tree, the
birch and the hawthorn, and of the veneration of the Welsh Gypsies to
the fasciated vegetable growth known to them as the Broado
Koro.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1968src" href="#xd21e1968" name=
"xd21e1968src">8</a> In the same way an attempt has been made to
connect the Bel tree with the Saiva worship of the Lingam and the lotus
with the Yon&icirc;. But this part of the subject has been involved in
so much crude speculation that any analogies of this kind, however
tempting, must be accepted with the utmost caution.</p>
<p>Further than this, it may be reasonably suspected that this cultus
rests to some extent on a basis of totemism. Some of the evidence in
support of this view will be discussed elsewhere, but it is, on the
analogy of the various modes in which the Br&acirc;hmanical pantheon
has been recruited, not improbable that trees and plants, like the
Tulas&icirc; and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87"
name="pb87">87</a>]</span>P&icirc;pal, may have been originally tribal
totems imported into Br&acirc;hmanism from some aboriginal or other
foreign source.</p>
<p>On the whole it is tolerably certain that there is more in tree
worship than can be accounted for either by Mr. Ferguson&rsquo;s theory
that the worship sprang from a perception of the utility or beauty of
trees, or by Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s theory of nicknames. It is sufficient
to say that both fail to account for the worship of insignificant and
comparatively useless shrubs, weeds, or grasses.</p>
<p>Tree worship holds an important part in the popular ritual and
folk-lore. This is shown by the prejudice against cutting trees. The
jungle tribes are very averse to cutting certain trees, particularly
those which are regarded as sacred. If a Kharw&acirc;r, except at the
time of the annual feast, cuts his tribal tree, the Karama, he loses
wealth and life, and none of these tribes will cut the large S&acirc;l
trees which are fixed by the Baiga as the abode of the forest godling.
This feeling prevails very strongly among the Maghs of Bengal. Nothing
but positive orders and the presence of Europeans would induce them to
trespass on many hill-tops, which they regarded as occupied by the tree
demons. With the Europeans, however, they would advance fearlessly, and
did not hesitate to fell trees, the blame of such sacrilege being
always laid on the strangers. On felling any large tree, one of the
party was always prepared with a green sprig, which he ran and placed
in the centre of the stump when the tree fell, as a propitiation to the
spirit which had been displaced so roughly, pleading at the same time
the orders of the strangers for the work. In clearing one spot an
orderly had to take the d&acirc;h or cleaver and fell the first tree
himself before a Magh would make a stroke, and was considered to bear
all the odium of the work with the disturbed spirits till the arrival
of the Europeans relieved him of the burden.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1979src" href="#xd21e1979" name="xd21e1979src">9</a></p>
<p>In folk-lore we have many magic trees. We have the Kalpataru or
Kalpadruma, also known as Kalpavriksha, or Manoratha dayaka, the tree
which grows in Swarga or the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href=
"#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>paradise of Indra and grants all
desires. There is, again, the P&acirc;rij&acirc;ta, which was produced
at the churning of the ocean, and appropriated by Indra, from whom it
was recovered by Krishna. The tree in the Meghad&ucirc;ta bears
clothes, trinkets, and wine, which is like the Juniper tree of the
German tale, which grants a woman a son. Many such trees appear in the
Indian folk-tales. The King Jimutaketu had a tree in his house which
came down from his ancestors, and was known as &ldquo;the giver of
desires&rdquo;; the generous Induprabha craved a boon from Indra, and
became a wishing tree in his own city; and the faithful minister of
Yasaketu sees a wave rise out of the sea and then a wishing tree
appears, &ldquo;adorned with boughs glittering with gold, embellished
with sprays of coral, bearing lovely fruits and flowers of jewels. And
he beheld on its trunk a maiden, alluring on account of her wonderful
beauty, reclining on a gem-bestudded couch.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1986src" href="#xd21e1986" name="xd21e1986src">10</a> So, in
the story of Devadatta, the tree is cloven and a heavenly nymph
appears. We have trees which, like those in the Odyssey, bear fruit and
flowers at the same time, and in the garden of the Asura maiden
&ldquo;the trees were ever producing flowers and fruits, for all
seasons were present there at the same time.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1989src" href="#xd21e1989" name="xd21e1989src">11</a></p>
<p>We have many trees, again, which are produced in miraculous ways. In
one of the modern tales the tiger collects the bones of his friend, the
cow, and from her ashes spring two bamboos, which when cut give blood,
and are found to be two boys of exquisite grace and beauty.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1994src" href="#xd21e1994" name=
"xd21e1994src">12</a> So in Grimm&rsquo;s tale of &ldquo;One Eye, Two
Eyes, and Three Eyes,&rdquo; the tree grows from the buried entrails of
the goat. In another of Somadeva&rsquo;s stories the heroine drops a
tear on the Jambu flower and a fruit grew, within which a maiden was
produced.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1997src" href="#xd21e1997" name=
"xd21e1997src">13</a> The incident of the tree which grows on the
mother&rsquo;s grave and protects her helpless children is the common
property of folk-lore. Again, we have the heavenly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>fruit
which was given by the grateful monkey, and freed him who ate it from
old age and disease, like the tree in Aelian which makes an old man
become younger and younger until he reaches the antenatal stage of
non-existence.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2002src" href="#xd21e2002"
name="xd21e2002src">14</a></p>
<p>We have many instances of trees which talk. The mango tree shows the
hero how the magic bird is to be cut out of it; the heroine is blessed
and aided by the plantain tree, cotton tree, and sweet basil; she is
rewarded by a plum and fig tree for services rendered to them.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2008src" href="#xd21e2008" name=
"xd21e2008src">15</a> In one of the Kashm&icirc;r tales the tree
informs the hero of the safety of his wife. So, in Grimm&rsquo;s tale
of the &ldquo;Lucky Spinner,&rdquo; the tree speaks when the man is
about to cut it down.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2011src" href=
"#xd21e2011" name="xd21e2011src">16</a></p>
<p>In one of the stories, as a link between tree and serpent worship,
the great palace of the snake king is situated under a solitary Asoka
tree in the Vindhyan forest. In the same collection we meet continually
instances of tree worship. The Br&acirc;hman Somadatta worships a great
Asvattha, or fig tree, by walking round it so as to keep it on his
right, bowing and making an oblation; Mrigankadatta takes refuge in a
tree sacred to Ganesa; and Narav&acirc;hanadatta comes to a sandal tree
surrounded with a platform made of precious jewels, up which he climbs
by means of ladders and adores it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2019src"
href="#xd21e2019" name="xd21e2019src">17</a></p>
<p>We have a long series of legends by which certain famous trees are
supposed to have been produced from the tooth twig of some saint. The
famous hawthorn of Glastonbury was supposed to be sprung from the staff
of Joseph of Arimathea, who having fixed it in the ground on Christmas
Day, it took root immediately, put forth leaves, and the next day was
covered with milk-white blossoms.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2024src"
href="#xd21e2024" name="xd21e2024src">18</a> Traditions of the
Dantadh&acirc;vana or tooth-brush tree of Buddha still exist at Gonda;
another at Ludhi&acirc;na is attributed to Abdul Q&acirc;dir
Jil&acirc;ni; there is a Buddha tree at Saketa, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>the
great Banyan tree at Broach was similarly produced by Kab&icirc;r. So,
the Sant&acirc;ls believe that good men turn into fruit-trees.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2029src" href="#xd21e2029" name=
"xd21e2029src">19</a></p>
<p>Next come the numerous sacred groves scattered all over the country.
These, as we have seen, are very often regarded as a survival from the
primeval jungle, where the forest spirits have taken refuge. The idea
is common both to the Aryan as well as to the Dr&acirc;vidian races,
from the latter of whom it was possibly derived.</p>
<p>Thus, among the jungle races we find that there are many groves,
known as Sarna, in which the Cheros and Kharw&acirc;rs offer triennial
sacrifices of a buffalo or other animal. The Kis&acirc;ns have sacred
groves, called S&acirc;. The Mund&acirc;ri Kols keep &ldquo;a fragment
of the original forest, the trees in which have been for ages carefully
protected, left when the clearance was first made, lest the sylvan gods
of the place, disgusted at the wholesale felling of the trees which
protected them, should abandon the locality. Even now if a tree is
destroyed in the sacred grove, the gods evince their displeasure by
withholding seasonable rain.&rdquo; This idea of the influence of
cutting trees on weather has been illustrated by Mr. Frazer from the
usages of other races.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2036src" href=
"#xd21e2036" name="xd21e2036src">20</a> So, among the Kh&acirc;ndhs,
&ldquo;that timber may never be wanting, in case of accidents from fire
or from enemies, a considerable grove, generally of S&acirc;l, is
uniformly dedicated by every village to the forest god, whose favour is
ever and anon sought by the sacrifice of birds, hogs, and sheep, with
the usual accompaniments of rice and an addled egg. The consecrated
grove is religiously preserved, the trees being occasionally pruned,
but not a twig cut for use without the formal consent of the village
and the formal propitiation of the god.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2039src" href="#xd21e2039" name="xd21e2039src">21</a> Among the
Kols, in these groves the tutelary deities of the village are supposed
to sojourn when attending to the wants of their votaries.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2042src" href="#xd21e2042" name=
"xd21e2042src">22</a> In the Central Provinces <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>the
Badiyas worship the manes of their ancestors in a grove of S&acirc;j
trees.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2047src" href="#xd21e2047" name=
"xd21e2047src">23</a> In Ber&acirc;r the wood of the Pathrot forests is
believed to be dedicated to a neighbouring temple, and no one will cut
or buy it; and in other places in the same province the sacred groves
are so carefully preserved, that during the annual festivals held in
them it is the custom to collect and burn solemnly all dead and fallen
branches and trees.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2051src" href=
"#xd21e2051" name="xd21e2051src">24</a></p>
<p>Among the higher races the same feelings attach to the holy groves
of Mathura, each of which has appropriated one of the legends of the
Krishna myth. Thus, there is a particularly sacred grove at
Bhadanw&acirc;ra, and it is believed that any one violating the
sanctity of the place by telling a lie within its precincts will be
stricken with leprosy. In another at Hasanpur Bara the trees are under
the protection of the curse of a Faq&icirc;r, and in many places people
object to having toddy collected from the palm trees, because it
necessitates cutting their necks.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2056src"
href="#xd21e2056" name="xd21e2056src">25</a> In the Northern Hills the
S&acirc;l and bamboos at Barmdeo are never cut, as they are sacred to
the local Dev&icirc;.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2059src" href=
"#xd21e2059" name="xd21e2059src">26</a> In Kulu, &ldquo;near the
village were a number of cypresses, much decayed, and many quite dead.
Some of my people had begun to strip off their dry branches for fuel,
when one of the conductors of our caravan came to me in great
agitation, and implored me to command them to desist. The trees, he
said, were sacred to the deities of the elements, who would be sure to
revenge any injury done to them by visiting the neighbourhood with
heavy and untimely snow.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2062src"
href="#xd21e2062" name="xd21e2062src">27</a></p>
<p>In a village in Lucknow, noticeable among the trees is a
&ldquo;single mango tree, of fine growth and comely shape. It is the
survivor of some old grove, which the owner, through straitened
circumstances, has reluctantly cut down. He called it J&acirc;k, or
Sakhiya, the witness of the place where the old grove
stood.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2067src" href="#xd21e2067"
name="xd21e2067src">28</a> J&acirc;k is, as we have seen, the Corn
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>spirit. The preservation of these little patches
of the primeval jungle, with a view to conciliate the sylvan spirits of
the place, is exactly analogous to what is known in Scotland as the
&ldquo;Gudeman&rsquo;s Croft,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cloutie&rsquo;s
Croft,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gudeman&rsquo;s Field.&rdquo; Often in Northern
India little patches are left uncultivated in the corners of fields as
a refuge for the spirits, as in North Scotland many farmers leave a
corner of the field untilled, and say it is for the &ldquo;Aul
Man,&rdquo; or the Devil.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2072src" href=
"#xd21e2072" name="xd21e2072src">29</a></p>
<p>Some trees are, again, considered to be mystically connected with
the fortunes of people and places. Thus, the Chilbil tree at Gonda,
which, like others which have already been mentioned, sprouted from the
tooth-twig of a saint, was supposed to be mysteriously connected with
the fate of the last of the Gonda R&acirc;jas. His kingdom was to last
until the day a monkey sat on the tree, and this, it is said, happened
on the morning when the Mutiny broke out which ended in the ruin of the
dynasty.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2077src" href="#xd21e2077" name=
"xd21e2077src">30</a> In the same way the moving wood of Dunsinane was
fateful to the fortunes of Macbeth.</p>
<p>We have already referred to some of the regular tree sprites, like
the Churel, R&acirc;kshasa, and Bansapt&icirc; M&acirc;. They are, like
Kliddo, the North British sprite, small and delicate at first, but
rapidly shooting into the clouds, while everything it overshadows is
thrown into confusion.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2082src" href=
"#xd21e2082" name="xd21e2082src">31</a></p>
<p>How sprites come to inhabit trees is well shown in an instance given
from Bombay by Mr. Campbell. &ldquo;In the Dakkhin, when a man is
worried by a spirit, he gives it a tree to live in. The patient, or one
of his relations, goes to a seer and brings the seer to his house,
frankincense is burnt, and the sick man&rsquo;s spirit comes into the
seer&rsquo;s body. The people ask the spirit in the seer why the man is
sick. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>He says, &lsquo;The ghost of the man you killed
has come back, and is troubling you.&rsquo; Then they say, &lsquo;What
is to be done?&rsquo; The spirit says, &lsquo;Put him in a place in his
or in your land.&rsquo; The people say, &lsquo;How can we put
him?&rsquo; The spirit says, &lsquo;Take a cock, five cocoanuts, rice,
and red lead, and fill a bamboo basket with them next Sunday evening,
and by waving the basket round the head of the patient, take the ghost
out of the patient.&rsquo; When Sunday afternoon comes they call the
exorcist. If the ghost has not haunted the sick man for a week, it is
held that the man was worried by that ghost, who is now content with
the proposed arrangement. If the patient is still sick, it is held that
it cannot be that ghost, but it must be another ghost, perhaps a god
who troubles him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The seer is again called, and his familiar spirit comes into
him. They set the sick man opposite him, and the seer throws rice on
the sick man, and the ghost comes into the patient&rsquo;s body and
begins to speak. The seer asks him, &lsquo;Are you going or not?&rsquo;
The ghost replies, &lsquo;I will go if you give me a cock, a fowl, a
cocoanut, red lead, and rice.&rsquo; They then bring the articles and
show them to the spirit. The spirit sees the articles, and says,
&lsquo;Where is the cocoanut?&rsquo; or, &lsquo;Where is the
rice?&rsquo; They add what he says, and ask, &lsquo;Is it right?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yes, it is right,&rsquo; replies the spirit. &lsquo;If we drive
you out of B&acirc;pu, will you come out?&rsquo; ask the people.
&lsquo;I will come out,&rsquo; replies the ghost. The people then say,
&lsquo;Will you never come back?&rsquo; &lsquo;I will never
return,&rsquo; replies the ghost. &lsquo;If you ever return,&rsquo;
says the seer&rsquo;s spirit, &lsquo;I will put you in a tanner&rsquo;s
well, sink you, and ruin you.&rsquo; &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; says the
spirit, &lsquo;never come back, if you take these things to the
P&icirc;pal tree in my field. You must never hurt the P&icirc;pal. If
you hurt the P&icirc;pal, I will come and worry you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the friends of the patient make the cooked rice in a
ball, and work a little hollow in the top of the ball. They sprinkle
the ball with red powder, and in the hollow put a piece of a plantain
leaf, and on the leaf put oil, and a wick, which they light. Then the
G&acirc;di, or flesh-eating priest, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94"
href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>brings the goat in front of the
sick man, sprinkles the goat&rsquo;s head with red powder and flowers,
and says to the spirit, &lsquo;This is for you; take it.&rsquo; He then
passes three fowls three times from the head to the foot of the sick
man, and then from the head lowers all the other articles. The
G&acirc;di, or Mh&acirc;r, and some friends of the patient start for
the place named by the spirit. When the party leave, the sick man is
taken into the house and set close to the threshold. They put water on
his eyes, and filling a pot with water, throw it outside where the
articles were, and inside and outside scatter cowdung ashes, saying,
&lsquo;If you come in you will have the curse of R&acirc;ma and
Lakshmana.&rsquo; When the G&acirc;di and the party reach their
destination, the G&acirc;di tells the party to bring a stone the size
of a cocoanut. When the stone is brought, the G&acirc;di washes it and
puts it to the root of the tree and sets about it small stones. On the
tree and on the middle stone he puts red lead, red powder, and
frankincense. The people then tell the spirit to stay there, and
promise to give him a cocoanut every year if he does them no harm. They
then kill the goat and the fowls, and, letting the blood fall in front
of the stone, offer the heart and liver to the spirit, and then return
home.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2099src" href="#xd21e2099"
name="xd21e2099src">32</a></p>
<p>From ceremonies like these, in which a malignant spirit is entombed
in a tree and its surrounding stones, the transition to the general
belief in tree sprites is easy. The use of the various articles to
scare spirits will be understood from what has been already said on
that subject.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Karam Tree.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Passing on to trees which are considered specially
sacred, we find a good example in the Karam (<i lang="la-x-bio">Neuclea
parvifolia</i>), which is revered by the Kharw&acirc;rs, M&acirc;njhis,
and some of the other allied Dr&acirc;vidian races of the Vindhyan and
Kaim&ucirc;r ranges.</p>
<p>In Sh&acirc;h&acirc;b&acirc;d, their great festival is the worship
of the sacred tree. &ldquo;Commenced early in the bright portion of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>the month Bh&acirc;don (August&mdash;September),
it continues for fifteen days. It marks the gladness with which people
wind up their agricultural operations all over the world. The
festivities begin with a fast during the day. In the evening the young
men of the village only proceed in a gay circle to the forest. A leafy
branch of the Karam is selected, cut, and daubed with red lead and
butter. Brought in due state, it is planted in the yard in front of the
house, and is decorated with wreaths of wild flowers, such as autumn
yields to the Hill men with a bountiful hand. The homely ritual of the
Kharw&acirc;r then follows, and is finished with the offering of corn
and molasses. The worship over, the head of the village community
serves the men with a suitable feast. But the great rejoicing of the
season is reserved for a later hour. After dinner the men and women
appear in their gala dress, and range themselves in two opposite rows.
The M&acirc;ndar, or national drum of the aborigines, is then struck,
and the dance commences with a movement forward, until the men and
women draw close. Once face to face, a gradual movement towards the
right is commenced, and the men and women advance in a slow but merry
circle, which takes about an hour to describe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the influence of the example of the Hindus, the
practice of a national dance in which women take a prominent part is
already on the decline. When indulged in, it is done with an amount of
privacy, closed to the public, but open to the members of the race
only. It is difficult, however, to explain why the Karam tree should be
so greatly adored by the Kharw&acirc;rs. It is an insignificant tree,
with small leaves, which hardly affords shelter or shade, and possesses
no title to be considered superior to others in its native forest. Nor
in the religious belief of the Kharw&acirc;rs have we been able to
trace any classic tale connected with the growth of the Karam grove,
similar to that of the peaceful olive of old, or aromatic laurel. One
important, though the last incident of the Karam worship is the
appearance of the demon to the Kharw&acirc;r village men. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>Generally at the conclusion of the dance the demon
takes possession of a Kharw&acirc;r, who commences to talk, tremble,
and jump, and ultimately climbs up the branch of the Karam and begins
to eat the leaves. Consultation about the fortunes of the year then
takes place, and when the demon has foretold them the festivities are
concluded.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2120src" href="#xd21e2120"
name="xd21e2120src">33</a></p>
<p>This account omits two important points which enable us to explain
the meaning of the rite. The first is that when the festivities are
over the branch of the Karam tree is taken and thrown into a stream or
tank. This can hardly, on the analogy of similar practices to which
reference has been already made, be anything but a charm to produce
seasonable rain. Another is that sprigs of barley grown in a special
way, as at the Upper India festival of the Jay&icirc;, which will be
discussed later on, are offered to the tree. This must be an invocation
to the deity of the tree to prosper the growth of the autumn rice,
which is just at this time being planted out.</p>
<p>I have seen the Karama danced by the M&acirc;njhis, a
Dr&acirc;vidian tribe in Mirzapur, closely allied to the
Kharw&acirc;rs. The people there seem to affect no secrecy about it,
and are quite ready to come and dance before Europeans for a small
gratuity. The men expect to receive a little native liquor between the
acts, but the ladies of the ballet will accept only a light supper of
coarse sugar. The troupe consists of about a dozen men and the same
number of women. The sexes stand in rows opposite to each other, the
women clinging together, each with her arms clasped round her
neighbour&rsquo;s waist. One man carrying the sacred M&acirc;ndar drum,
beats it and leads the ballet, hopping about in a curious way on one
leg alternately. The two lines advance and retreat, the women bowing
low all the time, with their heads bending towards the ground, and
joining occasionally in the refrain. Most of the songs are apparently
modern, bearing on the adventures of R&acirc;ma, Lakshmana, and
S&icirc;t&acirc;; some are love songs, many of which are, as might have
been expected, rude and indecent. The whole scene is a curious picture
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>genuine aboriginal life. At the regular autumn
festival the ceremony degenerates into regular saturnalia, and is, if
common rumour be trusted, accompanied by an absolute abandonment of
decency and self-respect which culminates in the most unrestrained
debauchery.</p>
<p>The modern explanation of the dance is embodied in a folk-tale which
turns on the verbal confusion between Karam, the name of the tree, and
the Sanskrit Karma, meaning &ldquo;good works.&rdquo; It is, of course,
comparatively modern, and quite useless as a means for ascertaining the
real basis of the custom, which is probably a means of propitiating the
tree god to grant favourable weather.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Fig Tree.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among the sacred trees the various varieties of the
fig hold a conspicuous place. Many ideas have probably united in
securing reverence for them. Thus the Banyan with its numerous stems
may fitly be regarded as the home of gods or spirits. Others are valued
as a source of food, or because they possess juices valued as drink or
medicine.</p>
<p>Such is the Umbar, the Udambara of the Sanskrit writers, which is
known as Ksh&icirc;ra Vriksha or &ldquo;milk tree,&rdquo; and Hemadugha
or &ldquo;golden juiced,&rdquo; the Ficus glomerata of botanists, from
the succulent roots of which water can be found in times of drought.
The juice has, in popular belief, many valuable properties. A decoction
of it is useful for bile, melancholy, and fainting; it prevents
abortion and increases the mother&rsquo;s milk.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2138src" href="#xd21e2138" name="xd21e2138src">34</a> According
to the old ritual, of its wood is made the seat of the father god
Vivasvat, which is specially worshipped at the close of the Soma
sacrifice; the throne on which Soma is placed is made of it, and so is
the staff given by the Adhvaryu to the sacrificer at the initiation
rite, and the staff of the Vaisya student.</p>
<p>So with the P&icirc;pal (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ficus religiosa</i>),
which is connected with old temples, as it forces its roots into the
crumbling masonry, grows to a great age, and, like the poplar, moves
its leaves at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>the slightest breath of wind. The English
tradition about the aspen is that since its wood was used to make the
Cross it ever trembles with shame. The Pippala or Asvattha is said by
some to be the abode of Brahma, and is sometimes invested with the
sacred thread by the regular Upan&acirc;yana rite. Others say that in
it abide Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva, but specially Vishnu in his
incarnation as Krishna. Others, again, connect it with B&acirc;sdeo or
Vasudeva, the father of Krishna.</p>
<p>The Vata or Nyagrodha (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ficus Indica</i>) was,
according to the ancient ritual, possessed of many virtues, and the
king was directed to drink its juice instead of that of the
Soma.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2153src" href="#xd21e2153" name=
"xd21e2153src">35</a> The famous Allah&acirc;b&acirc;d fig tree is
mentioned in the R&acirc;m&acirc;yana and in the Uttara R&acirc;ma
Charitra. R&acirc;ma, S&icirc;t&acirc; and Lakshmana are said to have
rested beneath its branches. Another legend tells how the Rishi
M&acirc;rkandeya had the presumption to ask N&acirc;r&acirc;yana to
show him a specimen of his delusive power. The god in answer to his
prayer drowned the whole world in a sudden flood, and only the Akshaya
Vata or imperishable Banyan tree raised its head above the waters, with
a little child seated on its topmost bough, that put out its head and
saved the terrified saint just as he was on the point of drowning. The
Buddhist pilgrim, Hwen Thsang, says that in his time before the
principal room of the temple there was a tree with wide-spreading
branches, which was said to be the dwelling of a man-eating demon. The
tree was surrounded with human bones, the remains of pilgrims who had
offered themselves at the temple, a custom which had been observed from
time immemorial. General Cunningham identifies this tree with the
Akshaya Vata, which is still an object of worship. The well-known
Banyan tree of Ceylon is said to be descended from it.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2156src" href="#xd21e2156" name=
"xd21e2156src">36</a></p>
<p>It was under the Bodhi tree at Gaya that the Buddha obtained
enlightenment. The great sacred Banyan tree of the Him&acirc;laya is
said to have reached from Badarin&acirc;th to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>Nand
Pray&acirc;g, a distance of eighty miles.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2163src" href="#xd21e2163" name="xd21e2163src">37</a> In Bombay
women worship the Banyan tree on the fifteenth of the month of Jeth in
honour of Savitr&icirc;, the pious wife of Satyavan, who when her
husband was cutting a Banyan tree was struck by the axe and killed.
Yama appeared and claimed her husband, but at last he was overcome by
the devotion of Savitr&icirc; and restored her husband to her.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2166src" href="#xd21e2166" name=
"xd21e2166src">38</a></p>
<p>Of the G&ucirc;lar (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ficus glomerata</i>) it is
believed that on the night of the Div&acirc;l&icirc; the gods assemble
to pluck its flowers; hence no one has ever seen the tree in blossom.
It is unlucky to grow a G&ucirc;lar tree near the house, as it causes
the death of sons in the family.</p>
<p>High-caste Hindu women worship the P&icirc;pal tree in the form of
Vasudeva on the Am&acirc;vasya or fifteenth day of the month, when it
falls on Monday. They pour water at its roots, smear the trunk with red
lead and ground sandalwood, and walk round it one hundred and eight
times in the course of the sun, putting at each circuit a copper coin,
a sweetmeat, or a Br&acirc;hmanical cord at the root, all of which are
the perquisite of beggars. An old woman then recites the tale of the
R&acirc;ja Nikunjali and his queen Satyavrat&icirc;, who won her
husband by her devotion to the sacred tree. Hence devotion to it is
supposed to promote wedded happiness.</p>
<p>In <span class="corr" id="xd21e2178" title=
"Source: R&acirc;jputana">R&acirc;jput&acirc;na</span> the P&icirc;pal
and Banyan are worshipped by women on the 29th day of Bais&acirc;kh
(April&ndash;May) to preserve them from widowhood.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2181src" href="#xd21e2181" name="xd21e2181src">39</a> The
P&icirc;pal is invoked at the rite of investiture with the sacred
thread at marriages and at the foundation-laying of houses. Vows are
made under its shade for the boon of male offspring, and pious women
veil their faces when they pass it. Many, as they revolve round it,
twist a string of soft cotton round the trunk. The vessel of water for
the comfort of the departing soul on its way to the land of the dead is
hung from its branches, and beneath it are placed the rough stones
which form the shrine of the village godling. Its wood is used in parts
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>the Aran&icirc;, or sacred fire-drill, and for
the spoons with which butter is poured on the holy fire. When its
branches are attacked by the lac insect, a branch on which they have
settled is taken to the Ganges at Allah&acirc;b&acirc;d and consigned
to the Ganges. This, it is believed, saves the tree from further
injury.</p>
<p>The tree should be touched only on Sunday, when Lakshm&icirc;, the
goddess of wealth, abides in it; on every other day of the week,
poverty and misfortune take up their quarters in it. The son of a
deceased parent should pour three hundred and sixty brass vessels of
water round its root to ensure the repose of the dead man. Hindus on
Sunday after bathing pour a vessel of water at its root and walk round
it four times. Milk and sugar are sometimes mixed with the water to
intensify the charm. When the new moon falls on Monday, pious Hindus
walk one hundred and eight times round it and wind cotton threads about
the trunk. In rich Hindu families small silver models of the tree
answer the same purpose. When a statement is made on oath, the witness
takes one of the leaves in his hand and invokes the gods above him to
crush him, as he crushes the leaf, if he is guilty of falsehood.</p>
<p>Though Sir Monier-Williams gives currency to it, it may be suspected
that the story of the Banyas who objected to P&icirc;pal trees being
planted in their b&acirc;z&acirc;r, as they could not carry on their
roguery under the shade of the holy tree, has been invented for the
delectation of the confiding European tourist. As a matter of fact you
will often see merchants plant the tree in the immediate neighbourhood
of their shops. It is needless to say that this regard for the
P&icirc;pal extends through Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Sumatra,
and Java.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2190src" href="#xd21e2190" name=

<p class="first">In the Panj&acirc;b the Jand tree (<i lang=

especially in those parts where it forms a chief feature in the larger
flora of the great arid grazing tracts. It is commonly selected to mark
the abode or shelter the shrine of some deity. It is to it that, as a
rule, rags are dedicated as offerings, and it is employed in the
marriage ceremonies of many tribes. Most Khatris and Br&acirc;hmans
perform rites to it, especially at festivals connected with domestic
occurrences. A custom prevails in some families of never putting
home-made clothes upon the children, but of begging them from friends.
This is, as we have already seen, done with the view of avoiding the
Evil Eye. The ceremony of putting on these clothes is usually performed
when the child is three years of age. It is taken to the Jand tree,
from which a bough is cut with a sickle and planted at the root of the
tree as a propitiation of the indwelling spirit. The Sw&acirc;stika
symbol is made before it with the rice, flour, and sugar brought as an
offering to the tree. Nine threads from the Mauli, or string used by
women to tie up their back hair, are then taken out and cut into
lengths, one of which is tied round the tree with the knot
characteristic of Siva or Krishna, and another round a piece of dried
molasses, which is placed on the Sw&acirc;stika. Mantras or spells are
repeated and the sugar and rice are distributed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>among the women and children; for no male adult,
except the officiating Br&acirc;hman, attends the ceremony. The
Br&acirc;hman then dresses the child in the new clothes, on which he
impresses the mark of his hand in saffron, and girds the child&rsquo;s
loins with a hair string, on which is tied the bag or purse containing
the Br&acirc;hman&rsquo;s fee. The hair string has in front a
triangular piece of red silk, which, as we have already noticed, is one
of the most familiar forms of amulet intended to repel the influence of
evil spirits. Similarly at marriages, they perform the ceremony of
cutting off and burning a small branch of the tree, and offerings are
made to it by the relations of persons suffering from
small-pox.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2224src" href="#xd21e2224" name=

being fed under it, hair strings (<i>mauli</i>) being tied round it,
and seven circumambulations made in the course of the sun. The eleventh
of the month Ph&acirc;lgun (February) is sacred to it, and on this
occasion libations are poured at the foot of the tree, a string of red

Dv&icirc;pas or great divisions of the known continent, and to a
special hell, in which the wicked are tortured with the K&ucirc;ta

S&icirc;tal&acirc; and her six sisters. Hence during the season when

<p>The N&icirc;m tree is also connected with snake worship, as its
leaves repel snakes. In this it resembles the Yggdrassil of Europe, the
roots of which were half destroyed by the serpents which nestled among

mystic tree of Teutonic mythology, are still regarded throughout all
Northern Europe as a powerful protective from all manner of snakes and
evil worms.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2283src" href="#xd21e2283" name=

<p>The leaves are also used throughout Northern India as a means of

spirit which accompanies the mourners <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

ground. Hence after the funeral they chew the leaves and some water is
sprinkled over them with a branch of the tree. &ldquo;So great is the
power of the N&icirc;m over spirits and spirit disease, that in Bombay,
when a woman is delivered of a child, N&icirc;m leaves and cow&rsquo;s
urine are, as a rule, kept at the entrance of the lying-in room, in
order that the child and its mother may not be affected by an evil
spirit, and on their New Year&rsquo;s Day it is considered essential
for every Hindu to worship the N&icirc;m tree and to eat its leaves
mixed with pepper and sugar, that he may not suffer from any sickness
or disease during the year. In practice very few worship the tree, but
its leaves are generally eaten by most of them. Among the
Chitp&acirc;wan Br&acirc;hmans, a pot filled with cow&rsquo;s urine is
set at the door of the lying-in room with a N&icirc;m branch in it, and
anyone coming in must dip the branch in the urine and with it sprinkle
his feet. Among Govardhan Br&acirc;hmans of P&ucirc;na, when a child is
born, N&icirc;m leaves are hung at the front and back doors of the
house. In Ahmadnagar, when a person is bitten by a snake, he is taken
to Bhairoba&rsquo;s temple, crushed N&icirc;m leaves mixed with
chillies are given him to eat, and N&icirc;m leaves waved round his
head. Among the N&acirc;mdeo Shimpis of Ahmadnagar each of the mourners
carries from the pyre a twig of the N&icirc;m tree, and the Kanphatas
of Cutch get the cartilage of their ears slit, and in the slit a
N&icirc;m stick is stuck, the wound being cured by a dressing of
N&icirc;m oil.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2296src" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The cocoanut is considered one of the most sacred
fruits, and is called Sr&icirc;phala, or the fruit of Sr&icirc;, the
goddess of prosperity. It is the symbol of fertility, and all through
Upper India is kept on shrines and presented by the priests to women
who desire children. One of the main causes of the respect paid to it
seems to be its resemblance to a human head, and hence it is often used
as a type of an actual human sacrifice. It is also revered for its uses
as food and a source of intoxicating liquor. But it is not a native of
Northern India, and is naturally more revered in its home along the
western coast. In Gujar&acirc;t and Kanara it represents the house
spirit, and is worshipped as a family god. The Konkan Kunbis put up and
worship a cocoanut for each of their relations who dies, and before
beginning to cut the rice, break a cocoanut and distribute it among the
reapers. The Prabhus, at every place where three roads meet, wave a
cocoanut round the face of the bridegroom, and break it into pieces to
repel evil influences. The Musalm&acirc;ns of the Dakkhin cut a
cocoanut and lime into pieces and throw them over the head of the
bridegroom to scare evil spirits. Among some classes of ascetics the
skull is broken at the time of cremation with a cocoanut in order to
allow the ghost to escape. In Western India, at the close of the rains,
cocoanuts are thrown in to pacify the sea. Its place as a substitute
for a human sacrifice in Northern India seems to have been taken by the
pumpkin, which is used in much the same way.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Khair, or Mimosa (<i>Acacia catechu</i>) seems to
owe most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>of the estimation in which it is held to its use
in producing the sacred fire. It forms, on account of its hardness, the
base of the Aran&icirc; or sacred fire-drill, and in it the wedge of
the softer P&icirc;pal wood works and fire is produced by friction. The
Y&ucirc;pa or sacrificial post to which the victim was tied for the
sacrifice was often made of this wood. In the great horse sacrifice of
the R&acirc;m&acirc;yana, twenty-one of these posts were erected, six
made of Vilva (<i>Agle marmelos</i>), six of Khadira or Acacia, six of
Pal&acirc;sa (<i>Butea frondosa</i>), one of Udumbara (<i>Ficus
glomerata</i>), Sleshmataka (<i>Cordia myxa</i>), and one of Devadru,
the Deod&acirc;r pine tree.</p>
<p>Of the Khair tree Bishop Heber thus writes in his Journal:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2340src" href="#xd21e2340" name=
"xd21e2340src">53</a> &ldquo;As I returned home I passed a fine tree of
the Mimosa, with leaves at a little distance so much resembling those
of the mountain ash, that I was for a moment deceived, and asked if it
did not bear fruit. He answered, &lsquo;No; but it was a very noble
tree, being called the &ldquo;Imperial tree,&rdquo; for its excellent
qualities.<span class="corr" id="xd21e2343" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> That it slept all night, and was alive
all day, withdrawing its leaves if any one attempted to touch them.
Above all, however, it was useful as a preservative against magic; a
sprig worn in the turban, or suspended over the bed, was a perfect
security against all spells, Evil Eye, etc., insomuch that the most
formidable wizard would not, if he could help it, approach its shade.
One indeed, they said, who was very renowned for his power (like
Lorrinite of Kehama) of killing plants and drying up their sap with a
look, had come to this very tree and gazed upon it intently;
&lsquo;but,&rsquo; said the old man, who told me this with an air of
triumph, &lsquo;look as he might, he could do the tree no harm,&rsquo;
a fact of which I made no question. I was amused and surprised to find
the superstition, which in England and Scotland attaches to the rowan
tree, here applied to a tree of nearly similar form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This superstition regarding the rowan tree and the elder is familiar
in European folk-lore. In Ireland the roots of the elder and those of
an apple tree which bears red apples, boiled together and drunk
fasting, expel evil <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108"
name="pb108">108</a>]</span>spirits. In connection with this idea that
the mimosa sleeps at night, pious Hindus prefer not to eat betel leaves
after sunset, as catechu forms part of the ingredients with which they
are prepared.</p>

the child is laid on a plantain leaf smeared with oil, the leaf is
changed daily, and the baby is thus treated for the period which is
less than the normal time of delivery. In Bengal, in consecrating an

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Tulas&icirc; or holy basil (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Ocymum sanctum</i>) is closely connected with the worship of
Vishnu. At the last census over eleven hundred persons in the
North-Western Provinces recorded themselves as worshippers of the
plant. It is known in Sanskrit as Haripriya, or &ldquo;the beloved of
Vishnu,&rdquo; and Bh&ucirc;taghni, or &ldquo;destroyer of
demons.&rdquo; It seems to owe the favour with which it is regarded to
its aromatic and healing properties. Vishnu, so runs the legend, was
fascinated with the beauty of Vrind&acirc;, the wife of
J&acirc;landhara, to redeem him from whose enthralment, the gods
applied to Lakshm&icirc;, Gaur&icirc;, and Swadh&acirc;. Each gave them
seed to sow where Vishnu was enchanted. The seeds given by the deities
sprang up as the Dh&acirc;tr&icirc; or Emblica Myrobalan, the
M&acirc;lat&icirc; or jasmine, and the Tulas&icirc;, or basil, and
appearing in female form they attracted the admiration of the deity and
saved him from the wiles of Vrind&acirc;.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Another legend comes from Bombay.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2432src" href="#xd21e2432" name="xd21e2432src">61</a>
Tulas&icirc; was daughter of the R&acirc;ja Dharmadhwaja, and by her
devotions gained the favour of Vishnu, but she married the demon
Sankhach&ucirc;da, who by the virtue of his wife overcame the gods.
They appealed to Vishnu, but he could not help them, as the demon was
his votary. At last it was resolved that he should personate her
husband and gain her love. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href=
"#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>When Tulas&icirc; was aware of the
deception she was about to curse him, but he pacified her by promising
to marry her and make her name immortal. He added that those women who
married an image of him to the Tulas&icirc; on the eleventh day of the
month K&acirc;rttik would prosper.</p>
<p>The Tulas&icirc; is also connected with S&icirc;t&acirc; and
Rukmin&icirc;, and the prayer to her is: &ldquo;I adore that
Tulas&icirc;, in whose roots are all the places of pilgrimage, in whose
centre are all the deities, and in whose upper branches are all the
Vedas.&rdquo; The plant is specially worshipped by women after bathing,
and more particularly at the full moon of K&acirc;rttik, if the bathing
be in the Ganges. The chief ceremony is, however, the marriage of the
infant Krishna to the plant, which is carried out by pious people,
often at a considerable cost, in accordance with the standard
ritual.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Pal&acirc;sa.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Pal&acirc;sa or Dh&acirc;k is sacred, partly on
account of its use in producing the sacred fire, and partly because its
orange blossoms are used to dye the coloured dust and water thrown
about at the Hol&icirc; festival. It is supposed to be in some way
connected with the Soma, and by one account was produced from the
feather of the falcon imbued with the Soma. Its trifoliate leaves
represent the trident, or the three great gods, Brahma, Vishnu, and
Siva, or birth, life, and death. The leaves are used to form the
platters employed at various feasts and religious rites; the wood in
the Y&ucirc;pa, or sacrificial pole, and in the funeral pyre.</p>
<p>In one respect it resembles the rowan, which is also a sacred tree,
but why this is so has been much debated. &ldquo;Possibly the
inaccessible rocks on which the tree is not unfrequently found to grow
and the conspicuous colour of its berries may have counted for
something, but this falls decidedly short of a solution of the
question. One kind of answer that would meet the case, provided it be
countenanced by facts, may be briefly indicated, namely, that the
berries of the rowan were used in some early period in the brewing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=

the first intoxicating drink known to the Teuto-Aryan
Celts.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2448src" href="#xd21e2448"
name="xd21e2448src">62</a> The connection between the Pal&acirc;sa and
the Soma perhaps indicates that this may have been the case. It was
again a Vedic custom to drive the cows from their calves by striking
them with a rod of a Pal&acirc;sa tree. In Yorkshire it used to be the
custom for &ldquo;farmers to have whip-stocks of rowan tree wood, and
it was held that thus supplied, they were safe against having their
draught fixed, or their horses made restive by a witch. If ever a
draught came to a standstill, then the nearest witchwood tree was
resorted to, and a stick cut to flog the horses on with, to the
discomfiture of the malevolent witch who had caused the
stoppage.&rdquo; In some parts of Scotland the milkmaid carries a
switch of the magical rowan to expel the demon which sometimes enters
the cow; and in Germany, striking the cow with this magical wand is
believed to render her fertile.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2451src"

Bab&ucirc;l tree, you will get the evil spirits which inhabit it into
your power. They tell of a man who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115"
href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>did this near
Sah&acirc;ranpur, who when taken to his cremation, no sooner was the
light set to his pyre than he got up and walked home, and is alive to
this day. His neighbours naturally look on his proceedings with a
certain degree of suspicion. The ghost of a man burnt with this wood
will not rest quietly, and any one who rests on a bed made of it is
afflicted with evil dreams. An old servant of mine once solemnly
remonstrated against the use of such a bed by his master. Such a bed,
he remarked, should be only used for a clergyman guest, who by virtue
of his profession is naturally protected against such uncanny
visitations.</p>

<h3 class="main">Tree Marriages.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We now come to discuss the curious custom of marriages
to trees. This prevails widely throughout Northern India. Thus, in some
parts of K&acirc;ngra, if a betrothed but as yet unmarried girl can
succeed in performing the marriage ceremony with the object of her
choice round a fire made in the jungle with certain wild plants, her
betrothal is annulled, and this informal marriage is
recognized.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2523src" href="#xd21e2523" name=
"xd21e2523src">69</a> In the Panj&acirc;b a Hindu cannot be legally
married a third time. So, if he wishes to take a third wife, he is
married to a Bab&ucirc;l tree (<i lang="la-x-bio">Acacia Arabica</i>),
or to the Akh plant (<i lang="la-x-bio">Asclepia gigantea</i>), first,
so that the wife he subsequently marries is counted as his fourth, and
the evil consequences of marrying a third time are thus
avoided.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2532src" href="#xd21e2532" name=
"xd21e2532src">70</a> In Bengal, writes Dr. Buchanan,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2535src" href="#xd21e2535" name="xd21e2535src">71</a>
&ldquo;Premature marriage is considered so necessary to Hindu ideas of
prosperity, that even the unfortunate children who are brought up for
prostitution are married with all due ceremony to a plantain tree,
before the age when they would be defiled by remaining single.&rdquo;
In the North-Western Provinces, among some of the higher classes of
Br&acirc;hmans, if a man happens to lose one or two wives and is
anxious to marry a third, the ceremony of his third <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>marriage is first gone through with an Akh
plant. The family priest takes the intending bridegroom to the fields
where there are Akh plants and repeats the marriage formula. This is
known as Arka Viv&acirc;h, or Akh marriage, and it is believed that the
plant itself dies soon after being married. In Oudh, it is very unlucky
to marry a couple if the ruling stars of the youth form a more powerful
combination than those of the female. The way to get out of the
difficulty is to marry the girl first to a P&icirc;pal tree. In the
Panj&acirc;b, rich people who have no children marry a Br&acirc;hman to
a Tulas&icirc; plant. The pseudo-father of the bride treats the
Br&acirc;hman ever afterwards as his son-in-law, which, it is needless
to say, is a very good thing for the Br&acirc;hman.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2541src" href="#xd21e2541" name="xd21e2541src">72</a> If the
birth of a child does not follow this ceremony, they have good reason
for apprehending that a messenger from Yama, the god of death, will
harass them on their way to the spirit world.</p>
<p>In Bombay, among the Kudva Kunbis of Gujar&acirc;t, when there are
certain difficulties in the marriage of a girl, she is married to a
mango or some other fruit tree. Mr. Campbell<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2546src" href="#xd21e2546" name="xd21e2546src">73</a> accounts
for this on the principle that a spirit fears trees, especially fruit
trees. Among another branch of the same tribe, when a girl is
marriageable and a bridegroom cannot be found, the practice is to
substitute a bunch of flowers, and the marriage ceremony proceeds. Next
day, by which time the flowers have begun to fade, they are thrown into
a well, and the bride of yesterday is considered a widow. As a widow
can marry at any time without social discredit, the parents find a
husband for her at their leisure.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2549src"
href="#xd21e2549" name="xd21e2549src">74</a></p>
<p>So in Bengal, the Rautiyas before the wedding go through the form of
marriage to a mango tree.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2554src" href=
"#xd21e2554" name="xd21e2554src">75</a> Among the Mund&acirc;ri Kols,
&ldquo;the bride and bridegroom are well anointed with turmeric, and
wedded, not to each other, but the bride to a Mahua tree, and the groom
to a mango, or both to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href=
"#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>mango trees. They are made to
touch the tree with red lead, and then to clasp it, and they are tied
to it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2559src" href="#xd21e2559"
name="xd21e2559src">76</a> Among the Kurm&icirc;s, the bridegroom on
the wedding morning is first married to a mango tree. He embraces the
tree, is for a time tied to it in a peculiar manner with a thread, and
he daubs it with red lead. Then the thread is removed from the tree,
and is used to attach some of the leaves to the bridegroom&rsquo;s
wrist. The bride is similarly wedded to a Mahua tree.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2562src" href="#xd21e2562" name="xd21e2562src">77</a></p>
<p>Similarly in the Him&acirc;layas, if anyone desires to marry a third
time, whether his other wives are alive or not, he is married to the
Akh plant. He builds an altar near the plant, or brings a branch home
and plants it near the altar. The regular marriage ceremony is then
performed, and a thread is wound ten times round the plant with the
recitation of appropriate verses. Four days the plant remains where it
was fixed, and on the fifth day the celebrant is entitled to commence
the marriage ceremony with his third wife. Similarly, a person is
married to an earthen jar, when from some conjunction of the planets
the omens are unfavourable, or when, from some bodily or mental defect,
no one will marry the boy or girl. The usual ceremonies are gone
through, and the neck of the boy or girl is connected by a string with
the neck of the vessel, and water is sprinkled over them with a brush
made of five leaves.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2567src" href=
"#xd21e2567" name="xd21e2567src">78</a></p>
<p>In Nep&acirc;l every New&acirc;r girl is, while a child, married to
a Bel fruit, which, after the ceremony, is thrown into some sacred
river. When she arrives at puberty a husband is selected for her, but
should the marriage prove unpleasant, she can divorce herself by the
simple process of placing a betel-nut under her husband&rsquo;s pillow,
and walking off. Widows are allowed to re-marry; in fact, a New&acirc;r
woman is never a widow, as the Bel fruit to which she first married is
supposed to be always in existence.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2572src"
href="#xd21e2572" name="xd21e2572src">79</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>Before considering a possible explanation of this group of customs,
we may note other instances of pseudo-marriages. We have, in the first
place, instances of the marriage of girls to a god. &ldquo;In the
Gurg&acirc;on District, in the Rew&acirc;ri Tahs&icirc;l, at the
village of B&acirc;s Doda, a fair is held on the 26th of Chait and the
two following days. I was told that formerly girls of the Dh&icirc;nwar
class used to be married to the god at these festivals, and that they
always died soon afterwards, but that of late years the practice has
been discontinued.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2578src" href=
"#xd21e2578" name="xd21e2578src">80</a></p>
<p>Again, we have some traces of the allied custom of compulsory
religious prostitution. It is said that Sant&acirc;l girls are required
to submit to compulsory prostitution once in their lives at
Telk&ucirc;pi Gh&acirc;t. &ldquo;It is said that the custom originally
arose from the killing of a girl by her parents for incontinence; since
when, girls have been permitted to do as they please, and what was once
permissive has become compulsory.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2583src" href="#xd21e2583" name="xd21e2583src">81</a> There is no
reference to this in Colonel Dalton&rsquo;s account of the
Sant&acirc;ls, and Mr. Beglar&rsquo;s authority is not quite
satisfactory. But on the analogy of similar rites in Babylon, as
described by Herodotus, it is very likely that such a custom once
prevailed. There is some evidence that similar customs once prevailed
at the temple of Jaggann&acirc;th and other Indian shrines.</p>
<p>We have, again, folk-tale references to the same custom in a
tradition of the Vallabhach&acirc;rya sect of the daughter of a banker,
who, by her devotion to him, won the love of the god Krishna in the
form of an image. Finally the deity revealed himself, and she went with
him to Brindaban and remained with her divine husband till he carried
her off to the heaven of Vishnu. This, however, is hardly perhaps more
than an example of the mystic union of the god with his worshippers,
which forms such a large part of the Vaishnava hagiology, and is
familiar in the tales of Krishna and the Gop&icirc;s.</p>
<p>There is, again, among children in the neighbourhood of
Sah&acirc;ranpur, a game which may be a survival of some more
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>primitive rite. At the T&icirc;j festival, which
occurs in the rainy season, girls dressed in their best go to a tank
near the city. After dropping offerings into the water in honour of
Khw&acirc;ja Khizr, they divide into two parties, each of which selects
a leader, one of whom is known as the bride and the other a bridegroom.
The latter is decorated with a paper crown decked with tinsel. The
clothes of the pair are knotted together, and they are made to walk
round a Tulas&icirc; plant or a P&icirc;pal tree on the banks of the
tank, in a mock form of the marriage ritual. Meanwhile each party
chaffs the other, saying, &ldquo;Your bride (or bridegroom) is
one-eyed.&rdquo; They return home with merriment of this kind, and when
they come to the house the knot tied in the garments of the pair is
unloosed.</p>
<p>We have, again, instances of the marriages of, or to animals. In
parts of the Panj&acirc;b, if a man have lost two or three wives in
succession, he gets a woman to catch a bird and adopt it as her
daughter. He then marries the bird, and immediately pays over the
bride-gift to the woman that adopted his bird-bride, which he divorces.
After this he can get himself married to another woman, and she will
probably live.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2594src" href="#xd21e2594"
name="xd21e2594src">82</a></p>
<p>So, there have been many instances of R&acirc;jas marrying animals
with the customary rites. Some years ago, one of the
G&acirc;ekw&acirc;rs of Baroda spent a large sum in marrying some
favourite pigeons, and a R&acirc;ja of Nadiya spent a l&acirc;kh of
rupees in marrying two monkeys.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are numerous survivals of what can hardly be anything
else but tree marriage. Among the B&acirc;wariyas, a vagrant tribe in
Sirsa, the bride and bridegroom go outside the village to a Jand tree,
which, as we have seen already, is regarded as sacred, move round it
seven times, and then cut off a branch with an axe.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2602src" href="#xd21e2602" name="xd21e2602src">83</a> In a
Bh&icirc;l marriage, the pair walk round the Saly&acirc;ra tree, which
is placed in the marriage booth, twelve times.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2605src" href="#xd21e2605" name="xd21e2605src">84</a> We have a
similar custom among most of the menial tribes. The Kols make the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>marriage booth of nine bamboo poles, with a
bamboo or a branch of the Siddh tree as the central post. As the
bridegroom smears the parting of the bride&rsquo;s hair with red lead,
he makes a daub of the same substance on the tree. Much the same custom
prevails among all the inferior castes. The worship of trees at
marriage prevails in Madras, where some R&acirc;jas worship at their
marriages the fire and the Vahni tree, a twig of which is used as an
arrow at the hunting feast at the Navar&acirc;tri or Dasahra.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2610src" href="#xd21e2610" name=
"xd21e2610src">85</a></p>
<p>On the whole, it seems probable that this custom of pseudo-marriages
may be based on various principles. The popular explanation of the
custom is, as we have seen, that it is intended to avoid the curse of
widowhood, the tree-husband being always alive; the woman, even if her
husband die, can never be a widow, nor can the parents be liable to the
contempt which, according to popular Hindu belief, awaits those who
keep a girl who has reached maturity unmarried. But when we find the
same custom prevailing among races who habitually permit pre-nuptial
infidelity, and among whom every marriageable widow is either subjected
to the levirate or made over to a stranger, it seems obvious that this
cannot be the original explanation of the practice.</p>
<p>Again, according to Mr. Frazer, who has collected numerous examples
of the custom, &ldquo;it is difficult to separate from totemism the
custom observed by totem clans in Bengal of marrying the bride and
bridegroom to trees before they are married to each
other.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2617src" href="#xd21e2617"
name="xd21e2617src">86</a></p>
<div class="figure xd21e2621width"><img src="images/p2121.jpg" alt=
"DEV&Icirc; AND THE COBRA." width="422" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">DEV&Icirc; AND THE COBRA.</p>
</div>
<p>But the idea that, as we have seen in one of the cases of tree
marriages, the tree itself is supposed to die soon after the ceremony,
seems to point to the fact that the marriage may be intended to divert
to the tree some evil influence, which would otherwise attach to the
wedded pair. We have an instance of a somewhat analogous practice from
Bombay. &ldquo;Among the Konkan Kunbis, when a woman is in labour and
cannot get a speedy delivery, some gold ornament from her hair is taken
to a R&ucirc;&icirc; plant (the Dh&acirc;k&mdash;<span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span><i lang="la-x-bio">Callotropis gigantea</i> of
Northern India), and after digging at its roots, one of the roots is
taken out, and the ornament is buried in its stead. The root is then
brought home and put in the hair of the woman in labour. It is supposed
that by this means the woman gets speedy delivery. As soon as she is
delivered of a child, the root is taken from her hair and brought back
to the R&ucirc;&icirc; plant, and after digging at its root the
ornament is taken out and the root placed in its former
place.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2631src" href="#xd21e2631"
name="xd21e2631src">87</a> The idea seems to be that the evil influence
hindering parturition is thus transferred to the plant. And this may be
one explanation of the practice where, as we have seen, a man is
married to a bird, or so on, when his former wives have died. The bird
acts as the scape-animal, and carries the disease spirit away with
it.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have seen instances in which the wedded pair are made to
clasp the tree or are tied to it in some special way. There are
numerous cases in which women, in order to procure offspring, clasp an
idol, like that of Hanum&acirc;n and one of the other guardian deities.
The clasping of the tree at marriage may possibly be a sort of
sympathetic magic to bring on the pair the fertility and power of
reproduction, of which vegetable life is the well-known symbol. We have
the same principle of the wedding of the grove to its well, and every
Hindu who goes to the expense of making a tank, does not drink of its
waters until he has married the tank to a plantain or some other tree
growing on its banks.</p>

<h3 class="main">Tree and Serpent Worship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the story of the king and his son, told in the
Bait&acirc;l Pach&icirc;si, the king supplicates the sacred tree to
give him a son. The request is granted, and the king then implores the
tree to make his people happy; the result was that poor wretches,
hitherto living in the woods, came forth and concerted measures to
seize his kingdom. Rather than shed blood, the old king, his queen, and
his son retired to a lofty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href=
"#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>mountain. There the son finds
something white lying under a mimosa tree. On inquiry he learnt that it
is a heap of serpents&rsquo; bones left there by Garuda, who comes
daily to feed on serpents. On hearing this, the king goes towards a
temple, but is arrested by the cry of a woman, who says: &ldquo;My son
to-day will be eaten by Garuda.&rdquo; She and her people were, in
fact, serpents in human shape. The king was moved to pity, and as in
the famous legend of Buddha and the tigress, he offered to expose
himself to Garuda in the room of her son. This is discovered; Garuda
releases the king, and at his request re-animates the serpents to whom
the bones belong.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2643src" href="#xd21e2643"
name="xd21e2643src">88</a></p>
<p>Here we have an example of the combination of tree and serpent
worship, and it would be easy to adduce more instances, as has been
done by Mr. Ferguson and other writers of his school. But in dealing
with this phase of belief much caution is required. As Dr. Tylor
observes: &ldquo;Serpent-worship unfortunately fell years ago into the
hands of speculative writers, who mixed it up with occult philosophies,
Druidical mysteries, and that portentous nonsense called the Arkite
symbolism, till now sober students hear the very name of ophiolatry
with a shiver.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2648src" href=
"#xd21e2648" name="xd21e2648src">89</a></p>
<p>It is almost needless to say that snake-worship prevails largely in
Northern India. The last census showed in the North-Western Provinces
over twenty-five thousand N&acirc;ga worshippers; one hundred and
twenty-three persons recorded themselves as votaries of G&ucirc;ga, the
snake god. There are also a certain number who worship S&acirc;np
Deot&acirc;, or the snake godling, and Ah&icirc;ran, another deity of
the same class, who is worshipped in Sult&acirc;npur by daily offerings
of red lead, water, and rice. Sokha, said to be the ghost of a
Br&acirc;hman killed by a snake, has nearly fourteen thousand
worshippers. In the Panj&acirc;b, again, there are over thirty-five
thousand special votaries of the snake godlings, of which the great
majority worship G&ucirc;ga. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href=
"#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>That the cultus of the snake has been derived from aboriginal
beliefs appears tolerably certain. The Hindus of Vedic times looked on
the serpent with fear and dislike. It was impersonated as Ahi or
Vritra, the snake demon which brings darkness and drives away the
kindly rain. The regular snake-worship, as we now find it, was
obviously of a later date.</p>
<p>It does not appear difficult to disentangle the ideas on which
snake-worship is based. To begin with, the snake is dreaded and revered
on account of the mysterious fear which is associated with it, its
stealthy habits, its sinuous motion, the cold fixity of its gaze, the
protrusion of its forked tongue, the suddenness and deadliness of its
attacks. It would be particularly dreaded by women, whose habits of
walking barefoot in fields in the early dawn, and groping in dark
corners of their huts, render them specially exposed to its malice. The
chief basis of the cultus would then be fear, as in the case of the
tiger and other beasts of prey.</p>
<p>It would soon be discovered that there were various harmless snakes
which would, as house-hunters, come to be identified with the ancestral
ghosts as the protectors of houses and goods. The power of controlling
and taming the more venomous snakes would then be discovered, and the
snake-charmer would come to be regarded as the wisest of mankind, as a
wizard, and finally as a priest. We have thus three aspects under which
the snake is worshipped by many savage races&mdash;as a dreaded enemy,
as the protector of home and treasure, as the accompaniment and
attribute of wisdom. The village temple would be often in early times a
storehouse of treasure, and the snake, respected as its guardian, would
finally, as in Kashm&icirc;r, be installed there as a god.</p>
<p>Next, we have the early connection between the serpent and the
powers of nature, the cloud and the rain, as appears in the familiar
Vedic legend of Indra and the Dragon Ahi, and Seshan&acirc;ga, the
great world serpent, which appears in so many of the primitive
mythologies.</p>
<p>The serpent would again receive respect as the emblem <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>of
life; his shape would, as in many forms of primitive ornament, be
associated with the ring, as a symbol of eternity; he is excessively
long-lived, and periodically renews his life.</p>
<p>He has, further, as in the Saiva cultus, become associated with
phallicism, and with the sexual powers, as in the Adam legend.
&ldquo;The serpent round the neck of Siva denotes the endless cycle of
recurring years, and a second necklace of skulls about his person, with
numerous other serpents, symbolizes the eternal revolution of ages and
the successive dissolution and regeneration of the races of
mankind.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2668src" href="#xd21e2668"
name="xd21e2668src">90</a></p>
<p>Lastly, the cultus may have a totemistic basis. As Strabo describes
the Ophiogeneis or serpent races of Phrygia actually retaining physical
affinity with the snakes to whom they were to be believed to be allied,
the Cheros of the eastern districts of the North-Western Provinces and
the Bais R&acirc;jputs of Oudh profess to be descended from the Great
Serpent. Gautama Buddha himself is said to have been of serpent
lineage.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2675width"><img src="images/p2124.jpg" alt=
"SIVA AND THE COBRA." width="720" height="561">
<p class="figureHead">SIVA AND THE COBRA.</p>
</div>
<p>But the great serpent race was that of the N&acirc;gas, to whom much
ill-considered argument and crude speculation have been devoted.
According to one theory they were Skythic emigrants from Central Asia,
but whether antecedent or subsequent to the so-called Aryan inroad is
disputed. They seem to have been accustomed to use the serpent as a
national symbol, and hence became identified with the snake. Some of
the myths seem to imply that they suffered persecution at the hands of
the Br&acirc;hmans, such as the tale of the burning of the
Kh&acirc;ndava forest, the opening scenes of the
Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata, and the exploits of the youthful Krishna. They
are, again, associated with Buddhism on monuments like those of Ajanta,
and another theory would make them out to be the Dasyus, or aboriginal
races of Upper India, who were the first to adopt Buddhism and were
exterminated in the Br&acirc;hmanical revival. Little, in fact, is
known of them, save that they may have been early worshippers
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>of the snake, may have embraced Buddhism, and
may have introduced the worship into India from some northern
home.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2683src" href="#xd21e2683" name=
"xd21e2683src">91</a> But Mr. Ferguson&rsquo;s theory that
snake-worship was of purely Turanian origin is, to say the least, very
doubtful, and his belief that Saivism is antagonistic to snake-worship,
and that Vaishnavism, which he regards as a modification of Buddhism,
encourages it, is opposed by the numerous examples of the connection of
the serpent with the Lingam.</p>

<p class="first">In various places snakes are provided with special
shrines. Thus, in Garhw&acirc;l, Seshan&acirc;ga is honoured at
Pandukeswar; Bhekal N&acirc;g at Ratg&acirc;on; Sangal N&acirc;g at
Talor; B&acirc;npa N&acirc;g at Marg&acirc;on, and many others of the

out that the sacrifice is accepted, and falls down in a state of

and Nep&acirc;l were in some remote period the abode of N&acirc;gas.
The milk of a cow is usually presented to a N&acirc;g, and goats and
sheep are usually sacrificed to him, as to other godlings. So far as I
am aware, the only place in the Him&acirc;laya where the living snake
is worshipped is at the foot of the Rotung pass.&rdquo;<a class=

<p>Curious as it may appear, all the Kashm&icirc;r temples were
originally surrounded by artificial tanks, constructed in order to
propitiate the N&acirc;gas. Ancient stones covered with figures of
snakes are occasionally to be seen worked up into the walls of modern
buildings. Abul Fazl says that in his time there were nearly seven
hundred figures of snake gods existing in Kashm&icirc;r. The snake, it
is needless to say, is a common emblem in temples all over the country.
An <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=

<p>Snake-worship appears constantly in history and legend. There is a
passage in Plutarch from which it appears to have been the custom to
sacrifice an old woman (previously condemned to death for some crime)
to the serpent gods by burying her alive on the banks of the Indus.
Ktesias also mentions the worship of snakes, and in the Buddhist
legends snakes are often referred to as the guardian deities of
towns.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2732src" href="#xd21e2732" name=

<p>In the folk-tales, Narav&acirc;hanadatta worships snakes in a grove
sacred to them, and Bh&icirc;mabhatta goes to the temple of the chief
of the snakes, which he finds full of long wreaths of flowers in form
like serpents, and a great lake sacred to V&acirc;suki, studded with
red lotuses, which seemed like clouds of smoke from the fume of snake

<p>A curious legend tells how Kadr&ucirc; and Vinat&acirc; were the two
wives of the patriarch Kasyapa, the former being the mother of the
serpent race, and the other of the birds. A discussion arose between
them regarding the colour of the tails of the horses of the sun,
Vinat&acirc; insisting that they were white and Kadr&ucirc; that they
were black. It was agreed that whichever of the two was proved to be
wrong should serve the other. So Kadr&ucirc; contrived to fasten one of
her black snakes on to the back of one of the horses, and Vinat&acirc;,
thinking this was the real tail, accepted defeat; so the snakes rule
the birds for ever.</p>
<p>Nahusha, according to one version of his legend, aspired to the love
of the queen of India when her husband concealed himself because he had
killed a Br&acirc;hman. A thousand Rishis bore the litter of the
presumptuous sinner through the air, and when in his pride he touched
Agastya Muni with his foot, the offended sage cursed him, and he became
a serpent. Finally he was pardoned by the intercession of <span class=

<p>Near Jait, in the Mathura District, is a tank with the broken statue
of a hooded serpent in it. Once upon a time a R&acirc;ja married a
princess from a distant land, and wished to bring her home with him.
She refused to come until he announced his lineage. Her husband told
her that she would regret her curiosity, but she persisted. At last he
took her to the river and warned her again, but in vain. Then he told
her not to be alarmed at anything she saw, adding that if she did so,
she would lose him. Saying this, he began to descend slowly into the
water, all the time trying to dissuade her, till the water rose to his
neck. Then, after a last attempt to induce her to abandon her
curiosity, he dived and reappeared in the form of a N&acirc;ga, and
raising his head over the water, he said, &ldquo;This is my lineage. I
am a N&acirc;gavansi.&rdquo; His wife could not suppress an exclamation
of grief, on which the N&acirc;ga was turned into stone, where he lies
to this day. Here we have another instance of the consequences of the
violation of the curiosity taboo.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2753src"

<p>The town of Nigohan in the Lucknow District is said to have been
founded by Raja N&acirc;huk of the Chandravansi line of kings. Near it
is a large tank, in which the legend says that the R&acirc;ja,
transformed into a snake for the sin of killing a Br&acirc;hman, was
compelled to live. Here at length the P&acirc;ndava brothers, in their
wanderings after their battle with the Kauravas, came, and as they went
to draw water, the serpent put to each of them five questions touching
the vanity of human wishes and the advantages of absorption from the
world. Four out of the five brethren failed to answer and were dragged
under the water, but the riddle was solved by the fifth. The spell was
thus loosed, and the R&acirc;ja&rsquo;s deliverer had come. The
P&acirc;ndu put his ring round the body of the serpent, and he was
restored to human form. In his gratitude he performed a great
sacrifice, and to this day the cultivators digging small wells in the
centre of the tank in the dry season, come across the burnt barley,
rice, and betel-nuts used in the sacrifices.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The old Buddhist traveller thus describes the serpent deity in the
temple at Sankisa in the Farrukh&acirc;b&acirc;d
District&mdash;&ldquo;A white-eared dragon is the patron of this body
of the priests. It is he who causes fertilizing and seasonable showers
of rain to fall within their country, and preserves it from plagues and
calamity, and so causes the priesthood to dwell in security. The
priests, in gratitude for these favours, have erected a dragon chapel,
and within it placed a seat for his accommodation; and, moreover, they
make special contributions in the shape of religious offerings to
provide the dragon with food. Towards the end of each season of rest,
the dragon incontinently assumes the form of a little serpent, both of
whose ears are white. The body of priests, recognizing him, place in
the midst for his use a copper vessel full of cream. The serpent then
proceeds to come down from the highest part of the alcove, all the
while moving, as though he would pay his respects to all those around
him. He then suddenly disappears. He makes his appearance once every
year.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2765src" href="#xd21e2765"
name="xd21e2765src">101</a></p>
<p>According to Gen. Cunningham, the only spot which can be identified
with any certainty at Sankisa is the tank of the N&acirc;ga, which
still exists to the south-east of the ruins. The name of the N&acirc;ga
is K&acirc;rewar, which appears to mean &ldquo;the black one,&rdquo;
and that of the tank Kandaiya T&acirc;l. Milk is still offered to him
on every day of May, the N&acirc;gpancham&icirc; festival in August,
and at any other time when rain is wanted.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2770src" href="#xd21e2770" name="xd21e2770src">102</a></p>
<p>There are many instances of this control of the N&acirc;ga over the
weather. Thus, in Nep&acirc;l, when R&acirc;ja Gunkamdeva committed
incest, the gods in their wrath withheld the rain. Finally the
R&acirc;ja managed to catch the great N&acirc;ga Karkotaka, and the
other N&acirc;gas came and worshipped him and gave him each a likeness
of himself drawn with his own blood, and declared that whenever there
was a drought hereafter, plentiful rain would fall as soon as these
pictures were worshipped.</p>
<p>So, Gorakhn&acirc;tha confined the nine N&acirc;gas, and there was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>a drought until Matsyendran&acirc;tha appeared
and released them, on which the clouds gave rain.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2779src" href="#xd21e2779" name="xd21e2779src">103</a></p>
<p>The plan of propitiating the N&acirc;ga with an offering of milk is
found also in the case of the Durham legend of the Lambton worm and the
dragon of Deerhurst in Gloucestershire.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2784src" href="#xd21e2784" name="xd21e2784src">104</a></p>
<p>The sacred dragons of this kind are innumerable. The Buddhist cave
at Pabhosa in the Allah&acirc;b&acirc;d District was the home of a
monster of this class, who was subdued by Buddha.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2789src" href="#xd21e2789" name="xd21e2789src">105</a> That in
the dragon tank at R&acirc;magr&acirc;ma used to assume the form of a
Br&acirc;hman.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2792src" href="#xd21e2792"
name="xd21e2792src">106</a> Dr. Buchanan tells of another at
Bh&acirc;galpur. &ldquo;They showed me a hole in a rock opening into a
hollow space close by the path leading up to their village. They said
that this hole was the abode of a very large serpent, which they
considered a kind of god. In cold weather they never saw it, but in the
hot season it was constantly observed lying in the hollow before its
den. The people pass by it without apprehension, thinking it
understands their language, and would on no account injure one of them,
should even a child or a drunken person fall on it.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2798src" href="#xd21e2798" name=
"xd21e2798src">107</a></p>
<p>But all such snakes are not friendly. In the Hitopadesa, the
faithful mungoose takes the place in the legend of Bethgelert of the
hound and kills the deadly snake. Some reference to this famous
folk-tale will be made in another connection. Agh&acirc;sura,
&ldquo;the evil demon,&rdquo; the king of the serpents, tried to devour
the divine infant Krishna. When he and his foster-father Nanda were
asleep together, a huge boa-constrictor laid hold of Nanda by the toe,
and would speedily have devoured him, but Krishna, hearing his cries,
ran to his side and lightly set his foot on the monster&rsquo;s head.
At the very touch the serpent was transformed, and assumed the figure
of a lovely youth; &ldquo;for years ago a Ganymede of Heaven&rsquo;s
Court, by name Sudarsana, in pride of beauty and exalted birth, had
vexed the holy sage Angiras when in deep <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

dancing backwards and forwards before him, and by his curses had been

until the advent of Krishna.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2805src"

snake gods. The serpent deity of Benares is N&acirc;g&icirc;swar, who
is represented by a serpent twining round the chief idol, and like his

one of the oldest shrines in the city.<a class="noteref" id=

B&acirc;suk N&acirc;g, has many shrines, and in all of them, as at
D&acirc;raganj, near Allah&acirc;b&acirc;d, described by Sir
Monier-Williams,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2825src" href="#xd21e2825"
name="xd21e2825src">112</a> the priest in charge is always a man of low
caste, a fact pointing to the non-Aryan character of the worship. He
forms one of the triad of the snake gods which rule the snakes of earth
and hell, his fellows being Sesha and Takshaka, &ldquo;he who cuts
off.&rdquo; V&acirc;suki often appears in the folk-tales. We find him
resisting Garuda, the destroyer of his subjects. His brother&rsquo;s
son Kirtisena is, according to one legend, a Br&acirc;hman, and weds a
mortal maiden by the Gandharva form; his eldest brother Vasunemi
presents a benevolent Savara with a magic lute; V&acirc;suki himself
marries the princess Yasodhar&acirc;, and their son is Priyadarsana.
V&acirc;suki has a thousand ears. Once he served the gods by becoming
the rope which the mount Mandara was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

wealth.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2830src" href="#xd21e2830" name=
"xd21e2830src">113</a> The foot of the celebrated iron pillar at Delhi
was driven so deep in order that it might rest on the head of
V&acirc;suki. A Br&acirc;hman told the king that this would secure the
stability of his kingdom. The R&acirc;ja doubted this, and had the
pillar dug up, when its base was found wet with the blood of the
serpent king. Owing to the incredulity of the R&acirc;ja it could never
again be firmly fixed, and his want of faith led to the ultimate
downfall of his dynasty. The same tale has reached the Him&acirc;laya,

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Next come the Sinhas, or snake godlings of the
Panj&acirc;b and the western parts of the North-Western Provinces.
&ldquo;They are males, and though they cause fever they are not very
malevolent, often taking away pain. They have got great power over
milch cattle, and the milk of the eleventh day after calving is sacred
to them, and libations of milk (as in the case of the Sankisa dragon)
are always acceptable. They are generally distinguished by some colour,
the most commonly worshipped being K&acirc;l&icirc;, &lsquo;the black
one,&rsquo; Hari, &lsquo;green,&rsquo; Bh&ucirc;ra, &lsquo;grey,&rsquo;
Sinh. But the diviner will often declare a fever to be caused by some
Sinh no one has ever heard of before, but to whom a shrine must be
built. And so they multiply in a most perplexing manner. Dead men also
have a way of becoming snakes&mdash;a fact which is revealed in a
dream, when again a shrine must be built. If a peasant sees a snake he
will salute it, and if it bite him, he or his heirs, as the case may
be, will build a shrine on the spot to prevent the recurrence of such
an occurrence. They are the servants of V&acirc;suki N&acirc;ga, King
of P&acirc;t&acirc;la, or Tartarus, and their worship is certainly
connected with that of the Pitris or ancestors, though it is difficult
to see exactly in what the connection lies.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"

<h3 class="main">Connection of Snakes with Ancestor-worship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The connection is thus explained by Mr. Spencer:
&ldquo;The other self of the dead relative is supposed to come back
occasionally to the old house; how else is it possible of the survivors
sleeping there to see him in their dreams? Here are creatures which
commonly, unlike wild animals, come into houses; come in, too, secretly
at night. The implication is clear. That snakes which specially do this
are the returned dead, is inferred by people in Asia, Africa, and
America; the haunting of houses being the common trait of the kind of
snakes reverenced and worshipped.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2854src" href="#xd21e2854" name="xd21e2854src">116</a> The
benevolent household snake, which in the folk-tales assists the hero
and protects the family of which he is the guardian, thus represents
the soul of some deceased ancestor which has taken up its residence
there. That the dead do appear as snakes is familiar in European
folk-lore. Thus, for instance, the pious &AElig;neas saw his father
Anchises in the snake which crept from his tomb. We have already come
across the same idea in the case of the Sat&icirc;. It was an old
European idea that this household snake, if not conciliated, and when
dead buried under the threshold, a sacred place, prevented
conception.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2857src" href="#xd21e2857" name=

G&ucirc;ga. With him are often worshipped his father Jaur or Jewar

<p>P&icirc;pa, the Br&acirc;hman, is another deity of the same class in
R&acirc;jput&acirc;na. He was in the habit of giving milk to a serpent
whose retreat was on the banks of the Sampu, or Snake Lake. The serpent
used in return to present him daily with two pieces of gold. Being
obliged to go away on business, he gave instructions to his son to
continue the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>offering; but the youth, deeming it a good
opportunity of becoming master of the treasure, took a stick with him,
and when the serpent came forth for his expected food, he struck him
violently. But the snake managed to retreat into his hole. On his
return, the young Br&acirc;hman related his adventures to his mother.
She was horrified at the account, and forthwith made arrangements for
sending her son away out of danger. But in the morning when she went to
call him she found to her horror that her son was dead, and a huge
snake lay coiled up beside his body. P&icirc;pa on his return was
inconsolable, but, stifling his thoughts of revenge, he propitiated the
monster with copious libations of milk. The serpent was appeased, and
revealed to P&icirc;pa the treasures which he guarded, commanding him
to erect a monument which should transmit the knowledge of the event to
future ages. Hence P&icirc;pa has become a sort of snake godling, and
the town of P&icirc;par and the Sampu Lake still by their names
commemorate the legend.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2872src" href=

<p>This famous tale, which was originally founded on a story in the

incident of the animals which produce gold is common both in European

spit gold, and every one knows Grimm&rsquo;s pretty tale of the

drops from the mouth of the good girl every time she speaks.</p>

apples of the Hesperides; in the Nibelungenlied the dragon Fafnir keeps
guard over a vast treasure of gold, which Sigurd seizes after he has
killed the monster. It is a common Indian belief that when a very rich
man dies without an heir, he cannot take away his thoughts from his
treasure, and returns to guard it in the form of a monstrous serpent.
But after a time he becomes tired of this serpent life, and either in a
dream, or assuming the human voice, he asks the persons living near the
treasure to take it and offer him one of their dearest relatives in
return. When some avaricious person complies with the serpent&rsquo;s
wishes, he gets possession of the wealth, and the serpent then enters
into some other state of existence. Instances of treasure speaking are
not uncommon. Some time ago two old ladies, whose houses were divided
by a wall, formally applied to me to have the wall excavated in the
presence of respectable witnesses, because a treasure-guarding snake
was often heard speaking from inside the wall, and begging some one to
take over the wealth which was in his charge.</p>
<p>Snake charmers are supposed to have the power of recognizing these
serpent treasure guardians, follow them stealthily to their holes, and
ask them to point out the deposit. This they will do in consideration
of the offering of a drop of blood from the little finger of a
first-born son,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2896src" href="#xd21e2896"
name="xd21e2896src">122</a> an obvious survival of human sacrifice,
which is constantly found connected with the serpent cultus.</p>
<p>Various suggestions have been made to account for the idea of snakes
guarding treasure. By one theory there is some connection between the
snake and primitive metallurgy; by another, that the snake may have
been the totem of the early jewellers; by a third, that the jewelled
head of the snake is at the bottom of the matter.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2901src" href="#xd21e2901" name="xd21e2901src">123</a> But it
seems more probable that the idea is based on the conception of the
snake as a haunter of houses and temples, and the divine protector of
the inmates and their wealth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136"
href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<p>Indian folk-lore is full of such stories. In the Dakkhin tale,
Seventee B&acirc;&icirc; gets possession of the enormous diamond which
the cobra used to take about in his mouth; and in the Bengal story
Faq&icirc;r Chand obtains the serpent&rsquo;s crest-jewel.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2907src" href="#xd21e2907" name=
"xd21e2907src">124</a> The same idea appears in the Arabian Nights. Mr.
Forbes tells rather a ghastly tale on this subject. He personally
investigated a mysterious chamber supposed to contain treasure. Viewed
from above it was a gloomy dungeon of great depth. He desired his men
to enter it, but they positively refused, alleging that &ldquo;wherever
money was concealed, there existed one of the Genii in the mortal form
of a snake to guard it.&rdquo; He at last prevailed on them to descend
by means of ropes. They had not been at the bottom many seconds, when
they called out vehemently that they were encircled by a large snake.
Finally he observed something like billets of wood, or rather more
resembling a ship&rsquo;s cable coiled up in a dark hole. Then he saw
the monster raise his head over an immense length of body, coiled in
volumes on the ground. A large snake was subsequently destroyed by
fire, but no treasure was found, &ldquo;the owner having doubtless
already removed it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2913src" href=

&ldquo;death-darting eye of cockatrice&rdquo; in &ldquo;Romeo and
Juliet.&rdquo; He has the power of spitting fire from his mouth, which
destroys his enemies and consumes forests. His saliva is venomous, and
there are many stories of snakes spitting venom into food. In one of
the versions of Bethgelert, the prince, but for his guardian bird,
would have drunk as water the venom of the black snakes which drips
from a tree. In the legends of R&acirc;ja Ras&acirc;lu, G&ucirc;ga, and
Newal D&acirc;&icirc;, the snake has power to kill and restore to life;
it has the faculty of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href=
"#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>metamorphosis and flying through
the air. In one of the Kashm&icirc;r tales, the Br&acirc;hman, wishing
to get rid of his wife, gives her a snake in a bag; but when she opens
it, it turns into a beautiful little boy.<a class="noteref" id=

again, the world-wide story of the snake rescued by the traveller,
which rewards the service rendered to him by biting his benefactor.
When Indra carried off the nectar, the snakes licked the bed of Kusa
grass on which the vessel lay. The sharp edges of the grass cut them as
they licked, so they have had double tongues ever since.<a class=

snake with a mouth at both ends, which is, as might have been expected,
most virulent. There are snake women, like Lamia or Vasudeva, the
mystic serpent, who go about at night, and by day resume their hateful
form. The humanity of the serpent race comes out clearly in the legend
of Saf&icirc;don, which attributes the leprosy still found in the

<h3 class="main">Modern Snake-worship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Some instances may be given of the form assumed by the
worship of the snake in modern times.</p>
<p>The great snake festival is the N&acirc;gpancham&icirc;, or
&ldquo;Dragon&rsquo;s fifth,&rdquo; held on the fifth day of the month
of Bh&acirc;don. In the Hills it is called the Rikh&icirc; or
Birur&icirc; Pancham&icirc;. Rikheswara has now become a title of Siva
as lord of the N&acirc;gas, a form in which he is represented as
surrounded by serpents and crowned with the chaplet of hooded snakes.
On the day of the feast the people paint figures of serpents and birds
on the walls of their houses, and seven days before the festival they
steep a mixture of wheat, gram, and pulse in water. On the morning of
the feast they take a wisp of grass, tie it up in the form of a snake,
dip it in the water in which the gram has <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>been steeped, and
offer it with money and sweetmeats to the serpents.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2944src" href="#xd21e2944" name="xd21e2944src">129</a></p>
<p>In Udaypur on this day they strew particular plants about the
thresholds of houses to prevent the entrance of venomous reptiles, and
in Nep&acirc;l the day is observed as the anniversary of a great
struggle between a famous N&acirc;ga and Garuda, the foe of the serpent
race.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2949src" href="#xd21e2949" name=
"xd21e2949src">130</a> In the eastern districts of the North-West
Provinces on this day milk and dried rice are poured into a
snake&rsquo;s hole; while doing this they call out &ldquo;Snake!
snake!&rdquo; The feeding of snakes on this holiday is done in much the
same way in Bombay.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2952src" href=
"#xd21e2952" name="xd21e2952src">131</a> After the Diw&acirc;l&icirc;
in K&acirc;ngra, a festival is held to bid good-bye to the snakes, at
which an image of the N&acirc;ga made of cowdung is worshipped. If a
snake be seen after this it is called &ldquo;ungrateful,&rdquo; and
immediately killed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2955src" href=
"#xd21e2955" name="xd21e2955src">132</a></p>
<p>In the North-Western Provinces the usual custom is for the head of
the family to bathe on the morning of the feast, to paint on the wall
of his sleeping-room two rude representations of serpents, and to make
offerings to Br&acirc;hmans. On this day people pray to what Dr.
Buchanan calls &ldquo;the chief eight dragons of the
pit,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2960src" href="#xd21e2960" name=
"xd21e2960src">133</a> girls throw some playthings into the water, and
labourers take a holiday and worship the tools of their craft.</p>
<p>In Beh&acirc;r during the month of S&acirc;wan (August) crowds of
women calling themselves N&acirc;gin, or &ldquo;wives of the
snake,&rdquo; go about begging for two and a half days, during which
period they neither sleep under a roof nor eat salt. Half the proceeds
of the begging are given to Br&acirc;hmans, and the other half invested
in salt and sweetmeats, which are eaten by all the people of the
village.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2965src" href="#xd21e2965" name=
"xd21e2965src">134</a></p>
<p>In Garhw&acirc;l, the ground is freely smeared with cowdung and mud,
and figures of five, seven, or nine serpents are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>rudely drawn with sandal-wood powder or tumeric;
rice, beans, or peas are parched; lamps are lighted and waved before
them; incense is burnt and food and fruit offered. These observances
take place both morning and evening, and the night is spent in
listening to stories in praises of the N&acirc;ga.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2972src" href="#xd21e2972" name="xd21e2972src">135</a></p>
<p>In parts of the North-Western Provinces, with the usual
N&acirc;gpancham&icirc;, is performed what is known as the Guru&icirc;
festival. On that day offerings are made by women to the Dragon godling
N&acirc;g Deot&acirc;. Girls let dolls float in the water of some
convenient river or tank, and the village lads beat the dolls with long
switches specially cut for the purpose. The legend of this rite is thus
told. When R&acirc;ja Janamej&acirc;ya held the Sarpa Sattra or snake
rite in order to destroy Takshaka, the king of the serpents, all the
snakes were captured by spells and killed. But Takshaka escaped and was
found to have taken refuge with Indra, on whose throne he seated
himself in the shape of a mosquito. Indra was ordered to produce the
fugitive, and begged the life of Takshaka, which was granted on
condition that he was banished from the land. So the snake king took
the shape of a Br&acirc;hman lad and retired to the Caucasus. There he
settled and married, but he foolishly told the story to his wife, and
she being unable to keep the secret, it finally reached the ears of
Janamej&acirc;ya, who sentenced him to death. Takshaka then retorted by
ordering Janamej&acirc;ya to cause everyone in his dominions to kill
his wife as a revenge for his own wife&rsquo;s treachery.
Janamej&acirc;ya was unwilling to issue such a cruel order, so he
consulted the Br&acirc;hmans. Finally, it was proclaimed that on the
N&acirc;gpancham&icirc;, every woman, to prove her devotion to her
husband, should make a doll and offer it up as a vicarious sacrifice
for herself. It would seem that the rite is the survival of some rite
of human sacrifice in connection with snake-worship.</p>
<p>The Agarw&acirc;la Banyas, who say that they are descended from
R&acirc;ja V&acirc;suki, have a special rite in honour of Astika Muni,
who is said to have been the instructor of V&acirc;suki. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>They
bathe and make marks representing the snake on the walls of the house,
which they worship, feed Br&acirc;hmans, and do the &Acirc;rt&icirc; or
lamp rite. Each woman takes home with her some of the sesamum offered
to the snake, which they sprinkle with the recitation of a spell in
their houses as a means of driving away venomous snakes.</p>

<h3 class="main">Cure of Snake-bite.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d there were once two
brothers, R&acirc;jawa and Soral; the ghost of the former cures
snake-bite, and that of the latter cattle murrain. The moment a man is
bitten, he must tie a string or a strip of his dress and fasten it
round his neck, crying, &ldquo;Mercy! O God R&acirc;jawa!&rdquo; To
call on Ghori B&acirc;dsh&acirc;h, the Delhi Emperor, who conquered the
country, or R&acirc;mj&icirc; D&acirc;s B&acirc;ba will do as well. At
the same time he makes a vow to give so much to the god if he recovers.
When he gets home they use various tests to ascertain if the poison is
in him still. They take him in and out over the threshold, and light a
lamp before him, acts which are supposed to have the effect of
developing latent poison. They then give him salt and leaves of the
bitter N&icirc;m tree. If he can take them he is safe. These are all,
as we have already seen, scarers of evil spirits, in this case the
snake demon. If he cannot take them, the whole village goes out and
cries to R&acirc;jawa Deo until he recovers. No one (Sir C. A.
Elliott&rsquo;s informant told him) had been ever known to die of a
snake-bite after this treatment. But the god has no power over the
dreaded Biscobra, which takes its name from the Hindi Bishkh&acirc;pra,
Sanskrit Vishakharpara, or &ldquo;poison-headed,&rdquo; which is said
to be so deadly that its very breath is venomous, one of the numerous
popular delusions out of which it is hopeless to argue the rustic. The
bitten man must not untie the string round his neck till the day when
he goes to offer what he vows, which should be, at latest, on the next
Dasahra; but if he attempts to cheat the god by offering ever so little
less than he promised, he will die on the spot in agonies.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2986src" href="#xd21e2986" name=
"xd21e2986src">136</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href=
"#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span></p>
<p>All through Upper India the stock remedy for snake-bite is the
exorcism of the Ojha or sorcerer, a performance known as Jh&acirc;r
Ph&ucirc;nk, consisting of a series of passes, massage, and
incantations, which are supposed to disperse the venom. Many, too, have
faith in the so-called &ldquo;Snake stone,&rdquo; which seems to be
usually a piece of bone soaked in blood and repeatedly baked. This is
supposed to have absorbent properties and to draw the venom out of the
wound. It probably works by faith, and is as effective as the Achates
or Agate of which Pliny writes: &ldquo;People are persuaded that it
availeth much against the venomous spiders and scorpions, which
property I could very well believe to be in the Sicilian Agate, for
that so soon as serpents come within the air and breath of the said
province of Sicily, as venomous as they be otherwise, they die
thereupon.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2992src" href="#xd21e2992"

<h3 class="main">The Snake in Folk-lore.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The references to the snake in folk-lore and popular
belief are so numerous that only a few examples can be given. The
Dh&acirc;man (<i>Ptyas mucosus</i>), a quite harmless snake, is said in
Bombay to give a fatal bite on Sundays, and to kill cattle by crawling
under them, or putting its tail up their nostrils. Its shadow is also
considered malignant. It is believed to suck the milk of cattle, and
that if a buffalo is looked on by it, it immediately dies. Of the
Ghonas snake it is believed that it bites only at night, and at
whatever hour of the night the victim is bitten, he dies just before
daybreak.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3003src" href="#xd21e3003" name=
"xd21e3003src">138</a></p>
<p>About these snake stones some curious tales are told. By one
account, when a goat kills a snake, it eats it and then ruminates,
after which it spits out a bead, which, when applied to a snake-bite,
absorbs the poison and swells. If it be put into milk, and squeezed,
the poison drips out of it like blood, and the bitten person is cured.
If it be not put in milk it will burst in pieces. By another account,
in the pouch-like appendages of the older Adjutant birds
(<i>Leptoptilos <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142"
name="pb142">142</a>]</span>Argala</i>) the fang of a snake is
sometimes found. This, if rubbed over the place where a poisonous snake
has bitten a man, is supposed to prevent the venom spreading to the
vital parts of the body. Others say that it is found within the head of
the Adjutant, and that it is only necessary to rub it to the bitten
place and put it into milk, when it becomes black through the venom.
What was known as the Ovum Anguinum of the Britons is said to have been
a bead which assists children to cut their teeth and cures the
chincough and the ague. Mr. Campbell<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3013src" href="#xd21e3013" name="xd21e3013src">139</a> says he
once possessed one of these &ldquo;snake&rsquo;s eggs,&rdquo; which was
a blue and white glass bead and supposed to be a charm used by the
women of the prehistoric races.</p>
<p>A very common incident in the folk-tales is that the heroine is
beset by snakes which come out of her nose or mouth at night and kill
her newly-wedded husband, as the evil spirit kills the husband of Sara
in the marriage chamber, until the hero lies awake and succeeds in
destroying them.</p>
<p>Another power snakes possess is that of identifying the rightful
heirs of kingdoms, and, as in the case of Drona, who found the
Ah&icirc;r Adir&acirc;ja sleeping in the shade of the hood of a cobra,
announce that he is born to rule.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3020src"
href="#xd21e3020" name="xd21e3020src">140</a> So in the mythology the
N&acirc;ga king Machalinda spreads his hood over the Buddha to protect
him from the rain and flies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3023src" href=
"#xd21e3023" name="xd21e3023src">141</a> Many of these N&acirc;gas
indeed are friendly, as in the case of the Banj&acirc;ra, who, in order
to avoid octroi duty, declared his valuable goods to be Glauber salts,
and Glauber salts they became until they were restored to their
original condition by the intercession of the kindly N&acirc;ga of the
Gundwa tank.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3026src" href="#xd21e3026"
name="xd21e3026src">142</a> In one of Somadeva&rsquo;s tales the
friendly snake clings round the R&acirc;ja till he promises to release
the Bodhisattwa out of prison.</p>

<p class="first">Snakes should, of course, be addressed euphemistically
as &ldquo;Maternal uncle,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rope,&rdquo; and if a snake
bites you, you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>should never mention its name, but say, &ldquo;A
rope has touched me.&rdquo; The Mirzapur Kharw&acirc;rs tell of a man
who once came on a N&acirc;gin laying her eggs. When she saw him she
fell at his feet and asked him to throw the eggs in a water-hole. So he
took up the eggs on a bamboo sieve and went with her to the brink. The
N&acirc;gin plunged in and said, &ldquo;Do not be afraid! Come
on!&rdquo; He followed her, the waters dried up, and he came to the
palace of the N&acirc;g, who entertained him royally, and offered to
give him anything he wished. The boor asked only for a pan, pot, and
spoon, which the N&acirc;ga gave him, and he came home to find his
relations doing the death ceremonies in his honour, believing he had
been carried off by a tiger. He said nothing of his adventures till the
day of his death, when he told the story. So the N&acirc;ga in other
tales of the same class blesses and rewards the lucky man who has
delivered the young snake from his persecutors who caught him while in
the upper air. So in the Arabian Nights, the relations of Jullanar of
the sea show their gratitude to the king who is kind to her on
earth.</p>
<p>On the basis of the same idea which has been already referred to in
the case of the Churel, it is believed that if the shadow of a pregnant
woman fall on a snake it becomes blind.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="first">The snake, like the &ldquo;toad ugly and
venomous,&rdquo; wears on his head the Mani or precious jewel, which is
a stock subject in Indian folk-tales. Thus, in one of Somadeva&rsquo;s
stories, &ldquo;when Nala heard this, he looked round, and beheld a
snake coiled up near the fire, having his head encircled with the rays
of the jewels of his crest.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3046src"
href="#xd21e3046" name="xd21e3046src">144</a> It is sometimes

silver jewelled tree; or it is possessed by the sleeping beauty, who
cannot return to her home beneath the waters, and loses the hero until

<p class="first">So the rainbow is connected with the snake, being the
fume of a gigantic serpent blown up from underground. In Persia it was
called the &ldquo;celestial serpent.&rdquo; We have already seen that
the Milky Way is regarded as the path of the N&acirc;gas in the sky. It
is possibly under the influence of the association of the snake, a
treasure guardian, that the English children run to find where the

<h3 class="main">The Household Snake.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The belief in the influence of the guardian domestic
or national snake is universal. When the Persians invaded Athens the
people would not leave the city till they learned that the guardian
snake had refused its food and abandoned the citadel. A snake at
Lanuvium and at Epirus resided in a grove and was waited on by a virgin
priestess, who entered naked and fed it once a year, when by its
acceptance or refusal of the offering, the prospects of the harvest
were ascertained. The Teutons and Celts had also their sacred guardian
snake.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3068width"><img src="images/p2144.jpg" alt=
"IMAGE OF THE HOUSEHOLD SNAKE." width="421" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">IMAGE OF THE HOUSEHOLD SNAKE.</p>
</div>
<p>In the Panj&acirc;b Hills, every householder keeps an image of the
N&acirc;ga or harmless snake, as contrasted with the S&acirc;np, which
is venomous. This snake is put in charge of the householder&rsquo;s
homestead, and is held responsible that no cobra or dangerous serpent
enters it. It is supposed to have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145"
href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>the power of driving all
cobras out of the place. Should rain drive the house snake out of his
hole, he is worshipped. No image of a cobra or other venomous snake is
ever made for purposes of worship. Ant-hills are believed to be the
homes of snakes, and there the people offer sugar, rice, and millet for
forty days.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3076src" href="#xd21e3076" name=
"xd21e3076src">147</a> These correspond to the benevolent domestic
snakes, of whom Aubrey says that &ldquo;the Bramens have them in great
veneration; they keep their corne. I think it is Tavernier mentions
it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3079src" href="#xd21e3079" name=

<p>They are, in fact, as we have already seen, the representatives of
the benevolent ancestral ghosts. Hence the deep-rooted prejudice
against killing the snake, which is both guardian and god.
&ldquo;If,&rdquo; says Mr. Lang,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3084src"
href="#xd21e3084" name="xd21e3084src">149</a> &ldquo;the serpent were
the deity of an earlier race, we could understand the prejudice against
killing it, as shown in the Apollo legend.&rdquo; The evidence
accumulated in this chapter will perhaps go some way to settle this
question, as far as India is concerned. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">Origin of Totemism.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As regards the origin of totemism great diversity of
opinion exists. Mr. Herbert Spencer considers that &ldquo;it arose from
a misinterpretation of nicknames; savages first took their names from
natural objects, and then confusing these objects with their ancestors
of the same name, paid the same respect to the material totem as they
were in the habit of doing to their own ancestors.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3121src" href="#xd21e3121" name="xd21e3121src">2</a>
The objection to this is, as Mr. Frazer shows, that it attributes to
verbal misunderstandings far more influence than, in spite of the
comparative mythologists, they ever seem to have exercised.</p>
<p>Sir J. Lubbock derives the idea from the practice of naming persons
and families after animals, but &ldquo;in dropping <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>the
intermediate links of ancestor-worship and verbal misunderstanding, he
has stripped the theory of all that lent it even an air of
plausibility.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3128src" href=
"#xd21e3128" name="xd21e3128src">3</a></p>
<p>Recent inquiries in the course of the Ethnographical Survey of
Bengal and the North-Western Provinces enable us perhaps to approach to
a solution of the problem.</p>
<p>To begin with, at a certain stage of culture the idea of the
connection between men and animals is exceedingly vivid, and reacts
powerfully on current beliefs. The animal or plant is supposed to have
a soul or spirit, like that of a human being, and this soul or spirit
is capable of transfer to the man or animal and <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>. This feeling comes out strongly in popular folk-lore,
much of which is made up of instances of metamorphosis such as these.
The witch or sorcerer is always changing into a tiger, a monkey, or a
fish; the princess is always appearing out of the aubergine or
pomegranate.</p>
<p>We have, again, the familiar theory to which reference has already
been made, that the demon or magician has an external soul, which he
keeps occasionally in the Life Index, which is often a bird, a tree,
and an animal. If this life index can be seized and destroyed, the life
of the monster is lost with it.</p>
<p>These principles, which are thoroughly congenial to the beliefs of
all primitive races, naturally suggest a much closer union between man
and other forms of animal or vegetable life than people of a higher
stage of development either accept or admit. With people, then, at this
stage of culture, the theory that the ancestor of the clan may have
been a bear or a tortoise would present no features of
improbability.</p>
<p>This theory accounts, as Mr. Frazer shows, for many of the obscure
rites of initiation which prevail among most savage tribes and in a
modified form among the Br&acirc;hmanized Hindus. The basis of such
rites is probably to extract the soul of the youth and temporarily
transfer it to the totem, from which in turn fresh life is infused into
him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span></p>
<p>Lastly, the result of the Indian evidence is that it is only in
connection with the rules of exogamy that totemism at the present day
displays any considerable degree of vitality. The real basis of exogamy
in Northern India seems to be the totem sept, which, however,
flourishes at the present day only among the Dr&acirc;vidian tribes and
those allied to them. But it would, it is almost certain, be incorrect
to say that while totemism is at present most active among the
Dr&acirc;vidians, in connection with marriage, it was peculiar to them.
It is more reasonable to infer that it continues to flourish among
these races, because of their isolation from Br&acirc;hmanical
influence. As among the inferior races of the Gangetic valley, the
primitive family customs connected with marriage, birth, and death have
undergone a process of denudation from their connection with the more
advanced Hindu races which surround them, so to a large degree in
Northern India, the totemistic sept names have been gradually shed off,
and replaced by an eponymous, local, or territorial nomenclature. In
short, under the pressure of higher culture, the kindred of the swan,
turtle, or parrot have preferred to call themselves Kanaujiya or
&ldquo;men of Kanauj,&rdquo; Sarwariya or &ldquo;residents of the land
beyond the Sarju river,&rdquo; and Raghuvansa or Bhriguvansa,
&ldquo;descendants of the sages Raghu or Bhrigu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We find, then, among such races, as might have been expected, that
at the present day the totemistic sept system exists only in obscure
and not easily recognizable forms. Folk etymology has also exercised
considerable influence, and a sept ashamed of its totemistic title
readily adopts some title of the eponymous type, or a local cognomen
sounding something like the name of the primitive totem. It is perhaps
too much to expect that a careful exploration of the sept titles or
tribal customs of Northern India will lead to extensive discoveries of
the primitive totemistic organization. The process of trituration which
has affected the caste nomenclature for such a lengthened period, and
the obscuration of primitive belief by association with more cultured
tribes, have been so continuous as to leave only a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>few
fragments and isolated survivals; but it is by a course of such inquiry
that the totemistic basis of the existing caste system can alone be
reached.</p>
<p>I have considered this question in the light of the most recent
evidence in another place,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3155src" href=
"#xd21e3155" name="xd21e3155src">4</a> and it is needless to repeat the
results which were there arrived at.</p>
<p>For the purpose of such an investigation it is convenient to have
some sort of working classification of the tests of, and the forms in
which, totemism usually appears. These have been laid down by the late
Professor Robertson-Smith as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The existence of stocks named after plants, animals, or
similar totems.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The prevalence of a conception that the members of the
stock are of the blood of the eponym, or are sprung from a plant, etc.,
of the species chosen as the totem.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) The ascription of a sacred character to the totem.</p>

<h3 class="main">Stocks Named from Animals, Plants, etc.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">First as to the stocks named from animals, plants,
etc. There are two divisions of the P&ucirc;ra Br&acirc;hmans of the
Dakkhin, known as Bakriy&acirc;r and Chheriy&acirc;r, founded on the
names of the male and female goat. In Upper India, the K&acirc;chhis or
market gardeners, and the Kachhw&acirc;ha sept of R&acirc;jputs allege
that they take their names from the Kachchhapa or tortoise, as the
Kurmis refer their name to the K&ucirc;rma or turtle. The Ahban
R&acirc;jputs and the Ahiw&acirc;sis of Mathura connect their names
with Ahi, the dragon. The Kalhans R&acirc;jputs derive their name from
the K&acirc;lahans or black goose. Among Br&acirc;hmans and other high
castes, Bh&acirc;radvaja, &ldquo;the lark, the bringer of food,&rdquo;
has given its name to many sections. Mr. Risley thinks that the fact of
there being a Kasyapa division of Kumh&acirc;rs or potters, who
venerate the tortoise, points to the name being a corruption of
Kachchhapa, the tortoise, in which case their name would have the same
origin as that of the K&acirc;chhis already mentioned. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p>Many people, again, claim kindred with the sun and moon. Such are
the Natchez of North America and the Incas of Peru.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3184src" href="#xd21e3184" name="xd21e3184src">5</a> There are
many children of the sun and moon in Arabia,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3187src" href="#xd21e3187" name="xd21e3187src">6</a> and gypsies
of the east of Europe have a legend that they are descended from the
sun and moon; the sun having debauched his moon sister, was condemned
to wander for ever, in consequence of which their descendants can never
rest.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3190src" href="#xd21e3190" name=
"xd21e3190src">7</a> So in India, the S&ucirc;rajbansi and Chandrabansi
R&acirc;jputs are said to take their names from S&ucirc;raj, the sun,

Kashm&icirc;r, and among the aboriginal tribes of the Him&acirc;layan

one of the nomad tribes of Persia, name their children usually not
after the Prophet, but after wild animals, such as the wolf, tiger, and
the like, adding some descriptive epithet. In the same way a tribe of
Lodi Path&acirc;ns in the Panj&acirc;b are known as N&acirc;har or
&ldquo;wolf.&rdquo; This is said to be due to their rapacity, and may
be as likely a nickname as a survival of totemism.<a class="noteref"

<h3 class="main">Totem Names among the Dr&acirc;vidians.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The evidence of this point is, as has been already
said, much more distinct among the Dr&acirc;vidians than among the more
Hinduized races. Details of such names among the Agariyas, Nats,
Baisw&acirc;rs, and Ghasiyas have been given in detail
elsewhere.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3206src" href="#xd21e3206" name=
"xd21e3206src">10</a> Thus, to take the Dh&acirc;ngars, a caste in
Mirzapur, allied to the Or&acirc;ons of Bengal, we find that they have
eight exogamous septs, all or most of which are of totemistic origin.
Thus, Ilha is said to mean a kind of fish, which members of this sept
do not eat; Kujur is a kind of jungle herb which this sept does not
use; Tirik is probably <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href=
"#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>the Tirki or bull sept of the
Or&acirc;ons. In Chota N&acirc;gpur, members of this sept do not touch
any cattle after their eyes are open. It illustrates the uncertainty of
these usages that in other places they say that the word Tirki means
&ldquo;young mice,&rdquo; which they are prohibited from
using.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3211src" href="#xd21e3211" name=
"xd21e3211src">11</a> Again, the Mirzapur sept of the Dh&acirc;ngars,
known as Lakara, is apparently identical with that called Lakrar among
the Bengal Or&acirc;ons, who must not eat tiger&rsquo;s flesh as they
are named after the tiger; in Mirzapur they derive their name from the
Lakar Bagha, or hy&aelig;na, which they will not hunt or kill. The Bara
sept is apparently the same as the Barar of the Or&acirc;ons, who will
not eat the leaves of the Bar tree or Ficus Indica. In Mirzapur they
will not cut this tree. The Ekka sept in Mirzapur say that this name
means &ldquo;leopard,&rdquo; an animal which they will not kill, but in
Chota N&acirc;gpur the same word is said to mean &ldquo;tortoise&rdquo;
and to be a totemistic sept of the Or&acirc;ons. So, the Mirzapur
Dh&acirc;ngars have a Tiga sept, which they say takes its name from a
jungle root which is prohibited to them; but the Or&acirc;ons of
Bh&acirc;galpur have a Tig sept, which, according to them, means
&ldquo;monkey.&rdquo; The last of the Mirzapur septs is the
Kh&acirc;ha, which, like the Khakkar sept of the Or&acirc;ons, means
&ldquo;crow,&rdquo; and neither will eat the bird. Similar instances
might be almost indefinitely repeated from usages of the allied tribes
in Mirzapur and the adjoining Bengal Districts.</p>

<p class="first">In the Panj&acirc;b there is a special snake tribe.
They observe every Monday and Thursday in the snake&rsquo;s honour,
cooking rice and milk, setting a portion aside for the snake, and never
eating or making butter on those days. If they find a dead snake, they
put clothes upon it, and give it a regular funeral. They will not kill
a snake, and say that its bite is harmless to them. The snake, they
say, changes its form every hundred years, and then becomes a man or a

tribal godling of the B&acirc;jgis. There is a well-known legend of a
queen of India, who is said to have sent to Alexander, among other
costly presents, a girl, who, having been fed with serpents from her
infancy, partook of their venomous nature. The well-known tale of Elsie

<h3 class="main">Totemism in Proper Names.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The subject of Indian proper names has not yet
received the attention it deserves. The only attempt to investigate the
subject, so far, is that of Major Temple.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3232src" href="#xd21e3232" name="xd21e3232src">14</a> In his
copious lists there is ample evidence that names are freely adopted
from those of animals, plants, etc. Thus we have Bagha,
&ldquo;Tiger&rdquo;; Bheriya, &ldquo;Wolf&rdquo;; Billa,
&ldquo;Cat&rdquo;; Ch&ucirc;ha, &ldquo;Rat,&rdquo; and so on from
animals; Bagla, &ldquo;Heron&rdquo;; Tota, &ldquo;Parrot,&rdquo; and so

Kachhua, &ldquo;Tortoise;&rdquo;; Bhaunra, &ldquo;Bumble Bee&rdquo;;
Ghun, &ldquo;Weevil&rdquo;; D&icirc;mak, &ldquo;White Ant,&rdquo; etc.
From plants come B&ucirc;ta, &ldquo;Tree&rdquo;; Harabansa,
&ldquo;Green Bamboo&rdquo; (or more probably Hari-vansa, &ldquo;the
genealogy of Hari&rdquo; or Vishnu); N&icirc;ma, &ldquo;N&icirc;m

&ldquo;Pepper&rdquo;; Bhutta, &ldquo;Maize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evidence of nomenclature must, of course, be received with
caution. The essence of totemism is a confessed belief in animal
descent, a name declaring that descent and some sacredness attached to
the animal or other fancied ancestor. Many of these names may be
nicknames, or titles of opprobrium <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153"
href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>selected, as we have already
shown, to baffle the Evil Eye or the influence of demons. Besides, as
has been pointed out, it does not necessarily follow because an
Englishman lives in &ldquo;Acacia Villa&rdquo; or &ldquo;Laburnum
Cottage,&rdquo; and calls his daughter &ldquo;Rose&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Violet,&rdquo; that he is in the totemistic stage. At the same
time, it is quite possible that further inquiry will discover undoubted
instances of totemism in the nomenclature of Northern India, as is the
case with other races in a similar stage of culture.</p>

<p class="first">We next come to Professor Robertson-Smith&rsquo;s

R&acirc;jput&acirc;na trace their descent from the monkey god
Hanum&acirc;n, and confirm it by alleging that the spine of their
princes is elongated like a tail. In the R&acirc;m&acirc;yana, one of
the wives of King S&acirc;gara gives birth to a son who continues the
race; the other wife produces an Ikshv&acirc;ku, a gourd or cane
containing sixty thousand sons. The famous Chandragupta was
miraculously preserved by the founder of his race, the bull
Chando.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3253src" href="#xd21e3253" name=

connected with the settlement of the Janw&acirc;r R&acirc;jputs in
Oudh, and they believe that the animal never preys on their children.
Every native believes that children are reared in the dens of wolves,
and there is a certain amount of respectable evidence in support of the

<p>Similar examples are numerous among the Dr&acirc;vidian tribes. The
Cheros of the Vindhyan plateau claim descent from the N&acirc;ga or
dragon. The R&acirc;ja and chief members of the Chota N&acirc;gpur
family wear turbans so arranged as to make the head-dress resemble a
serpent coiled round the skull, with its head projecting over the
wearer&rsquo;s brow. The seal of the Mah&acirc;r&acirc;ja and the arms
of his family show as a crest a cobra with a human face under its
expanded hood, surrounded with all the insignia of royalty. The
Sant&acirc;l legend ascribes the origin of the tribe to the wild goose,
and similar stories are told by the family of the R&acirc;ja of
Sinhbh&ucirc;m, the Hos, the Malers, and the K&ucirc;rs.<a class=

the cow and the serpent. Dr. Ball describes how some Kh&acirc;ndhs

<h3 class="main">The Devak.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One of the best illustrations of this form of totemism
is that of the Devak or family guardian gods of Ber&acirc;r and Bombay.
Before concluding an alliance, the Kunbi and other Ber&acirc;r tribes
look to the Devak, which literally means the deity worshipped at
marriage ceremonies; the fact being that certain families hold in
honour particular trees and plants, and at the marriage ceremony
branches of these trees are set up in the house. It is said that a
betrothal, in every other respect irreproachable, will be broken off if
the two houses are discovered to pay honour to the same tree, in other
words if they worship the same family totem and hence must belong to
one and the same endogamous group.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3317src"
href="#xd21e3317" name="xd21e3317src">29</a></p>
<p>The same custom prevails in Bombay. &ldquo;The usual Devaks are some
animals, like the elephant, stag, deer, or cock, or some tree, as the
Jambul, Ber, Mango, or Banyan. The Devak is the ancestor or the head of
the house, and so families which have the same guardian do not
intermarry. If the Devak be an animal, its flesh is not eaten; but if
it be a fruit tree, the use of the fruit generally is not forbidden,
though some families abstain from eating the fruit of the tree which
forms their Devak or badge.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3322src"
href="#xd21e3322" name="xd21e3322src">30</a> Mr. Campbell <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>gives numerous examples of these family totems,
such as wheat bread, a shell, an earthen pot, an axe, a Banyan tree, an
elephant. Oil-makers have as their totem an iron bar, or an oil-mill;
scent-makers use five piles, each of five earthen pots, with a lighted
lamp in the middle. The Bangars&rsquo; Devak is a conch-shell, that of
the Pardesi R&acirc;jputs an earthen pot filled with wheat, and so on.
Many of these are probably tribal or occupational fetishes, of which
instances will be given in another place.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The V&acirc;hanas and Avat&acirc;ras.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Some have professed to find indications of totemism in
the V&acirc;hanas and Avat&acirc;ras, the &ldquo;Vehicles&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;Incarnations&rdquo; of the mythology; but this is far from
certain. It has been suggested that these may represent tribal deities
imported into Hinduism. Brahma rides on the Hansa or goose; Vishnu on
Garuda, half eagle and half man, which is the crest of the Chandravansi
R&acirc;jputs; Siva on his bull Nandi; Yama on a buffalo;
K&acirc;rttikeya on a peacock; K&acirc;madeva on the marine monster
Makara, or on a parrot; Agni on a ram; Varuna on a fish. Ganesa is
accompanied by his rat, whence his name Akhuratha,
&ldquo;rat-borne.&rdquo; This an ingenious comparative mythologist
makes out to represent &ldquo;the pagan Sun god crushing under his feet
the mouse of night.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3332src" href=
"#xd21e3332" name="xd21e3332src">31</a> V&acirc;yu rides on an
antelope, Sani or Saturn on a vulture, and Durg&acirc; on a tiger.</p>
<p>The same is the case with the Avat&acirc;ras or incarnations of the
deities. Vishnu appears in the form of V&acirc;r&acirc;ha, the boar;
Kurma, the tortoise; Matsya, the fish; Nara Sinha, the man-lion; Kalki,
the white horse. Rudra and Indra are also represented in the form of
the boar.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Boar as a Totem.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">How the boar came to be associated with Vishnu has
been much disputed. One and not a very plausible explanation
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>which has been suggested is that it is because
the boar is a destroyer of snakes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3344src"
href="#xd21e3344" name="xd21e3344src">32</a> We know that in
R&acirc;jput&acirc;na there was a regular spring festival at which the
boar was killed because he was regarded as the special enemy of
Gaur&icirc;, the R&acirc;jput tribal goddess.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3347src" href="#xd21e3347" name="xd21e3347src">33</a></p>
<p>The comparative mythologists account for the spring boar festival by
connecting it with the ceremonial eating of the boar&rsquo;s head at
Christmas in Europe, as a symbol of the gloomy monster of winter,
killed at the winter solstice, after which the days get longer and
brighter.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3352src" href="#xd21e3352" name=
"xd21e3352src">34</a> Mr. Frazer explains it by the killing of the Corn
Spirit in the form of the boar.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3358src"
href="#xd21e3358" name="xd21e3358src">35</a></p>
<p>But it is, perhaps, simpler to believe with Sir A. Lyall<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3363src" href="#xd21e3363" name=
"xd21e3363src">36</a> that &ldquo;when the Br&acirc;hmans convert a
tribe of pig-worshipping aborigines, they tell their proselytes that
the pig was an Avat&acirc;r of Vishnu. The M&icirc;nas in one part of
R&acirc;jput&acirc;na used to worship the pig. When they took a turn
towards Isl&acirc;m they changed their pig into a saint called Father
Adam, and worshipped him as such.&rdquo; Mr. Frazer has pointed out
that the &ldquo;customs of the Egyptians touching the pig are to be
explained as based upon an opinion of the extreme sanctity rather than
of the extreme uncleanness of the animal; or rather to put it more
correctly, they imply that the animal was looked on not simply as a
filthy and a disgusting creature, but as a being endowed with high
supernatural powers, and that as such it was regarded with that
primitive sentiment of religious awe and fear in which the feelings of
reverence are almost equally blended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are indications of the same belief in India. Thus, in Baghera
&ldquo;the boar is a sacred animal, and the natives there say that if
any man were to kill a wild boar in the neighbourhood, he would be sure
to die immediately afterwards, while no such fatal result would follow
if the same man killed a boar anywhere else.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3368src" href="#xd21e3368" name="xd21e3368src">37</a> In the
same way the Prabhus of Bombay eat wild pork once a year as a religious
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>duty. The Vaddars of the Dakkhin say that they
are not troubled with ghosts, because the pork they eat and hang in
their houses scares ghosts. We know that among the Dr&acirc;vidian
races and many of the menial tribes of Hindust&acirc;n the pig is the
favourite offering to the local godlings and to the deities of disease.
Swine&rsquo;s teeth are often worn by Hindu ascetics, and among the
Kolarian races the women are forbidden to eat the flesh. In Northern
India the chief place where the worship of Vishnu in his
V&acirc;r&acirc;ha or boar incarnation is localized is at Soron on the
banks of the B&ucirc;rh&icirc; Gang&acirc;, or old Ganges, in the Etah
District. The name of the place has been derived from Sukarakshetra,
&ldquo;the place of the good deed,&rdquo; because here Vishnu slew the
demon Hiranyakesu. It is certainly Sukarakshetra, &ldquo;the plain of
the hog.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3373src" href="#xd21e3373"
name="xd21e3373src">38</a></p>
<p>Garuda, another of these vehicles, is the wonder-working bird common
to many mythologies&mdash;the Rukh of the Arabian Nights, the Eorosh of
the Zend, the Simurgh of the Persians, the Anka of the Arabs, the
Kargas of the Turks, the Kirni of the Japanese, the Dragon of China,
the Norka of Russia, the Ph&oelig;nix of classical fable, the Griffin
of chivalry and of Temple Bar.</p>
<p>From totemism we get a clue to many curious usages, especially in
the matter of food. From this idea probably arose the unclean beasts of
the Hebrew ritual. Many Hindu tribes will not eat the onion or the
turnip. Br&acirc;hmans and Bachgoti R&acirc;jputs object to potatoes.
The R&acirc;jputs place a special value on the wood of the N&icirc;m
tree; one clan alone, the Raikw&acirc;rs, are forbidden to use it as a
tooth-stick. Some Kolarian tribes, as we have already seen, refuse to
use the flesh or wool of the sheep. The Murmu, or Sant&acirc;ls of the
blue bull sept, will not eat the flesh of that animal. The system of
the Or&acirc;ons is more elaborate still, for no sub-tribe can eat the
plant or animal after which it is named. So, the Bansetti Binjhiyas,
who take their name from the bamboo, do not touch the tree at a
wedding; the Harbans Cham&acirc;rs, who are said to be in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>some
way connected with a bone (<i>hadda</i>), cannot wear bones in any
shape; the Rikhi&acirc;san Chiks do not eat beef or pork; the
Sanu&acirc;ni Dhenu&acirc;rs cannot wear gold; the Dhanu&acirc;r
Khariyas cannot eat rice gruel. Numerous instances of this kind are
given by Mr. Risley.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3385src" href=
"#xd21e3385" name="xd21e3385src">39</a> The transition from such
observances and restrictions to the elaborate food regulations of the
modern castes is not difficult.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Fetishism is &ldquo;the straightforward, objective
admiration of visible substances fancied to possess some mysterious
influence or faculty.... The original downright adoration of
queer-looking objects is modified by passing into the higher order of
imaginative superstition. First, the stone is the abode of some spirit,
its curious shape or position betraying possession. Next, the strange
form or aspect argues some design or handiwork of supernatural beings,
or is the vestige of their presence upon earth, and one step further
leads us to the regions of mythology and heroic legend.&rdquo;<a class=

&ldquo;It is sufficient for an Afgh&acirc;n devotee to see a small heap

which a tale can be invented, to imagine at once that some saint is
buried there. The idea conceived, he throws some more stones upon the
heap and sticks up a pole or flag; those who come after follow the
leader; more stones and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href=
"#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>more rags are added; at last its
dimensions are so considerable that it becomes the vogue; a Mullah is
always at hand with a legend which he makes or had revealed to him in a
dream; all the village believe it: a few pilgrims come; crowds follow;
miracles are wrought, and the game goes on, much to the satisfaction of
the holy speculator, who drives a good trade by it, till some other
Mullah more cunning than himself starts a saint of more recent date and
greater miraculous powers, when the traffic changes
hands.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3406src" href="#xd21e3406"

<p>The same process is daily going on before our eyes in Northern
India, and it would be difficult to suggest anything curious or
abnormal which the Hindu villager will not adopt as fetish.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Lorik Legend.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The legend of Lorik is very popular among the
Ah&icirc;r tribe, and has been localized in the Mirzapur District in a
curious way which admirably illustrates the principles which we have
been discussing. The story is related at wearisome length, but the main
features of it, according to the Sh&acirc;h&acirc;b&acirc;d version,
are as follows: Siudhar, an Ah&icirc;r, marries Chandan&icirc;, and is
cursed by P&acirc;rvat&icirc; with the loss of all passion.
Chandan&icirc; forms an attachment for her neighbour Lorik and elopes
with him. The husband pursues, fails to induce her to return, fights
Lorik and is beaten. The pair go and meet Mahapatiya, a Dus&acirc;dh,
the chief of the gamblers. He and Lorik play until the latter loses
everything, including the girl. She urges that her jewels did not form
part of the stake, and induces them to gamble again. She stands
opposite Mahapatiya and distracts his attention by giving him a glance
of her pretty ankles. Finally Lorik wins everything back. The girl then
tells Lorik how she has been insulted, and Lorik with his mighty sword
cuts off the gambler&rsquo;s head, when it and the body are turned into
stone.</p>
<p>Lorik had been betrothed to a girl named Satman&acirc;in, who was
not of age and had not joined her husband. Lorik had an adopted brother
named Semru. Lorik and Chandan&icirc;, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>after killing the
gambler, went on to Hardoi, near Mongir, where Lorik defeated a
R&acirc;ja and conquered his country. Lorik was finally seized and put
into a dungeon, whence he was released by the aid of the goddess
Durg&acirc;.</p>
<p>He again conquered the R&acirc;ja, recovered Chandan&icirc;, had a
son born to him, and gained considerable wealth. So they determined to
return to their native land.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Semru, Lorik&rsquo;s brother by adoption, had been killed
by the Kols and all his cattle and property were plundered.
Lorik&rsquo;s real wife, Satman&acirc;in, had grown into a handsome
woman, but still remained in her father&rsquo;s house. Lorik was
anxious to test her fidelity; so when she came to sell milk in his
camp, not knowing her husband, he stretched a loin cloth across the
entrance. All the other women stepped over it, but the delicacy of
Satman&acirc;in was so excessive that she would not put her foot across
it. Lorik was pleased, and filling her basket with jewels, covered them
with rice. When she returned, her sister saw the jewellery and charged
her with obtaining them as the price of her dishonour. She indignantly
denied the accusation, and her nephew, Semru&rsquo;s son, prepared to
fight Lorik to avenge the dishonour of his aunt. Next day the matter
was cleared up to the satisfaction of all parties.</p>
<p>Lorik then reigned with justice, and incurred the displeasure of
Indra, who sought to destroy him. So the goddess Durg&acirc; took the
form of his mistress Chandan&icirc; and tempted him. He succumbed to
her wiles, and she struck him so that his face turned completely round.
Overcome by grief and shame, he went to Benares, and there he and his
friends were turned into stone and sleep the sleep of magic at
Manikarnika Gh&acirc;t.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Mirzapur Version.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Mirzapur version is interesting from its
association with fetishism. As you descend the M&acirc;rkundi Pass into
the valley of the Son, you observe a large isolated boulder split into
two parts, with a narrow fissure between them. Further on in the bed of
the Son is a curious water-worn rock, which, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>to
the eye of faith, suggests a rude resemblance to a headless elephant.
On this foundation has been localized the legend of Lorik, which takes
us back to the time when the Aryan and the aboriginal Dasyu contended
for mastery in the wild borderland. There was once, so the tale runs, a
barbarian king who reigned at the fort of Agori, the frontier fortress
on the Son. Among his dependents was a cowherd maiden, named
Manjan&icirc;, who was loved by her clansman Lorik. He, with his
brother S&acirc;nwar, came to claim her as his bride. The R&acirc;ja
insisted on enforcing the <i lang="la">Jus primae noctis</i>. The
heroic brethren, in order to escape this infamy, carried off the
maiden. The R&acirc;ja pursued on his famous wild elephant, which Lorik
decapitated with a single blow.</p>
<p>When they reached in their flight the M&acirc;rkundi Pass, the wise
Manjan&icirc; advised Lorik to use her father&rsquo;s sword, which,
with admirable forethought, she had brought with her. He preferred his
own weapon, but she warned him to test both. His own sword broke to
pieces against the huge boulder of the Pass, but Manjan&icirc;&rsquo;s
weapon clave it in twain. So Lorik and his brother, with the aid of the
magic brand, defeated the infidel hosts with enormous slaughter, and
carried off the maiden in triumph.</p>
<p>If you doubt the story, there are the cloven boulder and the
petrified elephant to witness to its truth, and both are worshipped to
this day in the name of Lorik and his bride with offerings of milk and
grain.</p>
<p>This tale embodies a number of incidents which constantly appear in
the folk-tales. We have the gambling match in the
Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata and in the tale of Nala and Damayant&icirc;, as
well as in the Celtic legend of the young king of Easaidh
Ruadh.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3442src" href="#xd21e3442" name=
"xd21e3442src">42</a> The magic sword and the various fidelity tests
appear both in the folk-tales of the East and West. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>Of living creatures turned into stone we have many instances in
connection with the P&acirc;ndava legend, as in Cornwall, the granite
rocks known as the &ldquo;Merry Maidens&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Pipers&rdquo; are a party who broke the Sabbath, were struck by
lightning, and turned into stone.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3451src"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of a similar type is Jir&acirc;y&acirc;
Bhav&acirc;n&icirc;, who is worshipped at Jungail, south of the Son. In
her place of worship, a cave on the hillside, the only representative
of the goddess is an ancient rust-eaten coat of mail. This gives her
name, which is a corruption of the Persian Zirah, meaning a coat of
armour. Close by is a little stream, known as the Suaraiya, the meaning
of which is, of course, assumed to be &ldquo;Hog river,&rdquo; from the
Hindi S&ucirc;ar, a pig. Here we have all the elements of a myth. In
one of the early fights between Hindu and Musalm&acirc;n, a wounded
hero of Isl&acirc;m came staggering to the bank of the stream, and was
about to drink, when he heard that its name was connected with what is
an abomination to the true believer. So he preferred to die of thirst,
and no one sees any incongruity in the fact that the armour of a martyr
of the faith has become a form of the Hindu goddess. The shrine is now
on its promotion, and Jir&acirc;y&acirc; Bhav&acirc;n&icirc; will be
provided with a Sanskrit etymology and develop before long into a
genuine manifestation of K&acirc;l&icirc;.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Village Fetish Stones.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is hardly necessary to say that, as Sir J. Lubbock
has shown, the worship of fetish stones prevails in all parts of the
world.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3470src" href="#xd21e3470" name=
"xd21e3470src">44</a> There is hardly a village in Northern India
without a fetish of this kind, which is very often not appropriated to
any special deity, but represents the Gr&acirc;madevat&acirc;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>or G&acirc;nw-dev&icirc;, or Deoh&acirc;r, the
collective local divine cabinet which has the affairs of the community
under its charge.</p>
<p>Why spirits should live in stones has been debated. Mr. Campbell
perhaps presses the matter too far when he suggests that stones were by
early man found to contain fire, and that heated stones being found
useful in disease, cooking, and the like may have strengthened the
idea. &ldquo;The earliest theory was perhaps that as the life of the
millet was in the millet seed and the life of the Mango tree was in the
Mango stone, a human spirit could live in a rock or a pebble. The
belief that the soul, or part of the soul of a man, lives in his bones,
seems closely connected with the belief in the stone as a spirit house.
Probably it was an early belief that the bones should be kept, so that
if the spirit comes back and worries the survivors he may have a place
to go to.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3477src" href="#xd21e3477"
name="xd21e3477src">45</a></p>
<p>It is quite possible that the worship of stocks and stones may not
in all places be based on exactly the same train of ideas. To the ruder
races, the more curious or eccentric the form of the stone is, the more
likely it is to be the work and possibly the abode of a spirit, and in
a stoneless land, like the Gangetic plain, any stone is a wonder, and
likely to be revered. The conception of the worshipper will always vary
in regard to it. To the savage it will be the actual home or the
occasional resting-place of the spirit; to the idolater of more
advanced ideas it will be little more than a symbol, which reminds him
of the deity without shape or form whom he is bound to worship.</p>
<p>Other fetish stones, again, by their form prove that they are the
work of another or a higher race. Thus, on the village fetish mounds we
often find the carved relics of some Buddhistic shrine, or the
prehistoric stone implements, which were the work of a forgotten
people.</p>
<p>Lastly, many stones lend themselves directly to the needs of the
phallic cultus.</p>
<p>One form of stone is regarded with special reverence, those that
have holes or perforations. Among these may <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>be
mentioned the S&acirc;lagr&acirc;ma, a sort of ammonite found in the
Gandak river, which has perforations, said to be the work of the
Vajrak&icirc;ta insect and hence sacred to Vishnu. The story goes that
the divine N&acirc;r&acirc;yana once wandered through the world in the
form of the Vajrak&icirc;ta or golden bee. The gods, attracted by his
beauty, also took the form of bees, and whirled about him in such
numbers that Vishnu, afraid of the consequences, assumed the form of a
rock and stopped the moving of Garuda and the gods. On this Garuda,
followed by all the gods, made each a separate dwelling in the rock for
the conversion of the infidels. So the Cornish Milpreve, or adder stone
which is a preservative against vipers, is a ball of coralline
limestone, the sections in the coral being thought to be entangled
young snakes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3490src" href="#xd21e3490"
name="xd21e3490src">46</a> In Italy, pieces of stalagmite full of
cavities are valued as amulets.</p>
<p>The respect for these perforated stones rests, again, on the
well-known principle that looking through a stone which has a hole
bored through it improves the sight.</p>
<p>All over the world it is a recognized theory that creeping through
the orifice in a perforated stone or under an arching stone or tree is
a valuable remedy in cases of disease. Mr. Lane describes how women in
Cairo walk under the stone on which the decapitated bodies of criminals
are washed, in the hope of curing ophthalmia or procuring offspring.
The woman must do this in silence, and with the left foot
foremost.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3497src" href="#xd21e3497" name=
"xd21e3497src">47</a> In Cornwall, Mr. Hunt writes: &ldquo;In various
parts of the country there are, amongst the granitic masses, rocks
which have fallen across each other, leaving small openings, or there
are holes, low and narrow, extending under a pile of rocks. In nearly
every case of this kind, we find it is popularly stated that any one
suffering from rheumatism or lumbago would be cured if he crawled
through the opening. In some cases nine times are insisted on to make
the charm complete.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3500src" href=
"#xd21e3500" name="xd21e3500src">48</a> So, walking under a bramble
which has formed a second root in the earth is a cure for rheumatism,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>strumous children were passed nine times through
a cleft ash tree, against the sun. The tree was then bound up, and if
the bark grew the child was cured, if the tree died the death of the
child was sure to follow.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3505src" href=
"#xd21e3505" name="xd21e3505src">49</a></p>
<p>In the same way at many shrines it is part of the worship to creep
through a narrow orifice from one side to the other. At Kankhal,
worshippers at the temple of Daksha creep through a sort of tunnel from
one side to the other. The same is the rule at the temple at Kabraiya
in the Ham&icirc;rpur District, and at many other places of the same
kind.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3510src" href="#xd21e3510" name=
"xd21e3510src">50</a></p>
<p>The same principle probably accounts for the respect paid to the
grindstone. Part of the earliest form of the marriage ritual consisted
in the bride standing on the family grindstone. At the present day she
puts her foot upon it and knocks down little piles of heaped grain. It
is waved over the heads of the pair to scare evil spirits. In Bombay it
is said that sitting on a grindstone shortens life, and the Kunbis of
Kol&acirc;ba place a grindstone in the lying-in room, and on it set a
rice flour image of a woman, which is worshipped as the goddess, and
the baby is laid before it. Such a stone readily passes into a fetish,
as at Ahmadnagar, where there is a stone with two holes, which any two
fingers of any person&rsquo;s hand can fill, and the mosque where it
stands is, in consequence, much respected.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3515src" href="#xd21e3515" name="xd21e3515src">51</a></p>
<p>Much, however, of the worship of stones appears to be the result of
the respect paid to the tombstone or cairn, which, as we have already
said, keeps down the ghost of the dead man, and is often a place in
which his spirit chooses to reside.</p>
<p>These rude stones are very often smeared with ruddle or red ochre.
We have here a survival of the blood sacrifice of a human being or
animal which was once universal.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3523src"
href="#xd21e3523" name="xd21e3523src">52</a> Such sacrifices rest on
the principle that it is necessary to supply attendants to the dead or
to the tribal gods in the other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167"
href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>world; and the commutation of
human sacrifices, first into those of animals, and then into a mere
scarlet stain on the fetish stone, is a constantly recurring fact in
the history of custom.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3528src" href=

<h3 class="main">Human Sacrifice among the Indo-Aryans.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That human sacrifice prevailed among the early Aryans
in India is generally admitted. The whole question has been treated in
detail by that eminent Hindu scholar, Rajendra L&acirc;la Mitra. He
arrives at the conclusion that, looking to the history of the ancient
civilization and the ritual of the Hindus, there is nothing to justify
the belief that the Hindus were incapable of sacrificing human victims
to their gods; that the Sunasepha hymns of the Rig Veda Sanhita most
probably refer to a human sacrifice; that the Aitareya Br&acirc;hmana
refers to an actual and not to a typical human sacrifice; that the
Parushamedha originally required the actual sacrifice of men; that the
Taitareya Br&acirc;hmana enjoys the killing of a man at the horse
sacrifice; that the Satapatha Br&acirc;hmana sanctions human sacrifice
in some cases, but makes the Parushamedha emblematic; that the
Pur&acirc;nas recognize human sacrifices to Chandik&acirc;, but
prohibit the Parushamedha rite; that the Tantras enjoin human
sacrifices to Chandik&acirc;, and require that when human victims are
not available, an effigy of a human being should be sacrificed to
her.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3536src" href="#xd21e3536" name=

<h3 class="main">Human Sacrifice in the Folk-tales.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is ample evidence from the folk-tales of the
existence of human sacrifice in early times. We have in the tales of
Somadeva constant reference to human sacrifices <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>made
in honour of Chandik&acirc; or Ch&acirc;mund&acirc;. We find one
Muravara, a Turushka or Indo-Scythian, who proposes to make a human
sacrifice in memory of his dead father; we have expiatory sacrifices to
Chandik&acirc; to save the life of a king. In one of the Panj&acirc;b
tales a ship will not leave port till a human victim is offered. In one
of the modern tales we have an account of a man and his family who
sacrifice themselves before the god Jyoti Bara, &ldquo;the great
diviner,&rdquo; who is worshipped by the S&acirc;nsya gypsies.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3549src" href="#xd21e3549" name=
"xd21e3549src">55</a></p>
<p>The folk-tales also disclose ample evidence of cannibalism. The
Magian cannibals of the Book of Sindibad used to eat human flesh raw,
and the same tale is told by Herodotus of the Massagetae, the Padaei of
India, whom Col. Dalton identifies with the Birhors of Chota
N&acirc;gpur, and of the Essedones near Lake Moeotis.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3560src" href="#xd21e3560" name="xd21e3560src">56</a> It is
needless to say that Indian folk-tales abound with references to the
same practices. We have cannibal R&acirc;kshasas in abundance, and in
one of Somadeva&rsquo;s stories Devasw&acirc;min, the Br&acirc;hman,
looks out and finds his &ldquo;wife&rsquo;s mouth stained with blood,
for she had devoured his servant and left nothing of him but the
bones.&rdquo; And in the tale of Asokadatta we have a woman who climbs
on a stake and cuts slices of the flesh of an impaled criminal, which
she eats.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3563src" href="#xd21e3563" name=
"xd21e3563src">57</a> In the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata we find the legend
of Kalmashapada, who, while hunting, meets Saktri, son of Vasishtha,
and strikes him with his whip. The incensed sage cursed him to become a
cannibal. This curse was heard by Viswamitra, the rival of Vasishtha,
and he so contrived that the body of the king became possessed by a
man-eating R&acirc;kshasa. Kalmashapada devoured Saktri and the hundred
sons of Vasishtha, who finally restored him to his original state. In a
tale recently collected among the Dr&acirc;vidian M&acirc;njhis, a girl
accidentally cuts her finger and some of the blood falls upon the
greens, whereupon her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href=

<h3 class="main">Human Sacrifice in Modern Times.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Up to quite modern times the same was the case, and
there is some evidence to show that the custom has not quite
ceased.</p>
<p>Until the beginning of the present century, the custom of offering a
first-born child to the Ganges was common. Akin to this is the
Gang&acirc; J&acirc;tra, or murder of sick relatives on the banks of
the sacred river, of which a case occurred quite recently at Calcutta.
At Katwa, near Calcutta, a leper was burnt alive in 1812; he threw
himself into a pit ten cubits deep which was filled with burning coals.
He tried to escape, but his mother and sister thrust him in again and
he was burnt. They believed that by so doing he would gain a pure body
in the next birth.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3582src" href=
"#xd21e3582" name="xd21e3582src">59</a> Of this religious suicide in
Central India, Sir J. Malcolm wrote: &ldquo;Self-sacrifice of men is
less common than it used to be, and the men who do it are generally of
low tribes. One of their chief motives is that they will be born
R&acirc;jas at their next incarnation. Women who have been long barren,
vow their first child, if one be given to them, to Omk&acirc;r
Mandh&acirc;ta. The first knowledge imparted to the infant is this vow,
and the impression is so implanted in his mind, that years before his
death he seems like a man haunted by his destiny. There is a tradition
that anyone saved after the leap over the cliff near the shrine must be
made R&acirc;ja of the place; but to make this impossible, poison is
mixed with the last victuals given to the devoted man, who is compelled
to carry out his purpose.<span class="corr" id="xd21e3585" title=

<p>The modern instances of human sacrifice among the Kh&acirc;ndhs of
Bengal and the Mers of R&acirc;jput&acirc;na are sufficiently
notorious. It also prevailed among some of the Dr&acirc;vidian tribes
up to quite recent times. The Kharw&acirc;rs, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=

sacrifices to K&acirc;l&icirc; in the form of Chand&icirc;. Some of our
people who fell into their hands during the Mutiny were so dealt with.
The same was the case with the Bhuiyas, Kh&acirc;ndhs, and Mundas. Some
of the Gonds of Sarguja used to offer human sacrifice to Burha Deo, and
still go through a form of doing so.<a class="noteref" id=

recent instance quoted among the Tiyars, a class of boatmen in Benares;
one Tonur&acirc;m sacrificed four men in the hope of recovering the
treasures of seven R&acirc;jas; another man was killed to propitiate a
R&acirc;kshasa who guarded a treasure supposed to be concealed in a
house where the deed was committed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3600src"

<p>Of the Karh&acirc;da Br&acirc;hmans of Bombay, Sir J. Malcolm
writes:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3605src" href="#xd21e3605" name=
"xd21e3605src">63</a> &ldquo;The tribe of Br&acirc;hmans called
Karh&acirc;da had formerly a horrid custom of annually sacrificing to
their deities a young Br&acirc;hman. The Sakt&icirc; is supposed to
delight in human blood, and is represented with fiery eyes and covered
with red flowers. This goddess holds in one hand a sword and in the
other a battle-axe. The prayers of her votaries are directed to her
during the first nine days of the Dasahra feast, and on the evening of
the tenth a grand repast is prepared, to which the whole family is
invited. An intoxicating drug is contrived to be mixed with the food of
the intended victim, who is often a stranger whom the master of the
house has for several months treated with the greatest kindness and
attention, and sometimes, to lull suspicion, given him his daughter in
marriage. As soon as the poisonous and intoxicating drug operates, the
master of the house unattended takes the devoted person into the
temple, leads him three times round the idol, and on his prostrating
himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>before it, takes this opportunity of cutting his
throat. He collects with the greatest care the blood in a small bowl,
which he first applies to the lips of the ferocious goddess, and then
sprinkles it over her body; and a hole having been dug at the feet of
the idol for the corpse, he deposits it with great care to prevent
discovery. After this the Karh&acirc;da Br&acirc;hman returns to his
family, and spends the night in mirth and revelry, convinced that by
the bloodthirsty act he has propitiated the goddess for twelve years.
On the morning of the following day the corpse is taken from the hole
in which it had been thrown, and the idol deposited till next Dasahra,
when a similar sacrifice is made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There seems reason to suspect that even in the present day such
sacrifices are occasionally performed at remote shrines of
K&acirc;l&icirc; or Durg&acirc; Dev&icirc;. Within the last few years a
significant case of the kind occurred at Benares. There are numerous
instances from Nep&acirc;l.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3612src" href=
"#xd21e3612" name="xd21e3612src">64</a> At Jaypur, near Vizagapatam,
the R&acirc;ja is said, at his installation in 1861, to have sacrificed
a girl to Durg&acirc;.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3615src" href=
"#xd21e3615" name="xd21e3615src">65</a> A recent case of such sacrifice
with the object of recovering hidden treasure occurred in Ber&acirc;r;
a second connected with witchcraft at Muzaffarnagar.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3618src" href="#xd21e3618" name="xd21e3618src">66</a> At
Chanda and Lanji in the Province of N&acirc;gpur there are shrines to
K&acirc;l&icirc; at which human sacrifices to the goddess have been
offered almost within the memory of this generation.</p>
<p>Besides the religious form of human sacrifice in honour of one of
these bloodthirsty deities, there are forms of the rite which depend on
the mystic power attributed to human flesh and blood in various charms
and black magic.</p>
<p>In connection with human flesh a curious story is told of a man who
went to bathe in the Ganges, and met one of the abominable Faq&icirc;rs
known as Augars or Aghorpanthis, who carry about with them fragments of
a human corpse. He saw the Faq&icirc;r cut off and eat a piece of the
flesh of a corpse, and he then offered him a piece, saying <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>that
if he ate it he would become enormously rich. He refused the ghastly
food, and the Faq&icirc;r then threw a piece at him which stuck to his
head, forming a permanent lump.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3627src"
href="#xd21e3627" name="xd21e3627src">67</a> In one of the tales of
Somadeva the witches are seen flying about in the air, and say,
&ldquo;These are the magic powers of witches&rsquo; spells, and are due
to the eating of human flesh.&rdquo; In another the hero exchanges an
anklet with a woman for some human flesh.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3630src" href="#xd21e3630" name="xd21e3630src">68</a></p>
<p>The same mysterious power is attributed to human blood. The blood of
the Jinn has, it is hardly necessary to say, special powers of its own.
Thus, in one of the Kashm&icirc;r stories the angel says: &ldquo;This
is a most powerful Jinn. Should a drop of his blood fall to the ground
while life is in him, another Jinn will be quickly formed therefrom,
and spring up and slay you.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3635src"
href="#xd21e3635" name="xd21e3635src">69</a> Bathing in human blood has
been regarded as a powerful remedy for disease. The Emperor Constantine
was ordered a bath of children&rsquo;s blood, but moved by the prayers
of the parents, he forbore to apply the remedy and was rewarded by a
miraculous recovery. In one of the European folk-tales a woman desirous
of offspring is directed to take a horn and cup herself, draw out a
clot of blood, place it in a pot, lute it down and only uncover it in
the ninth month, when a child would be found in the pot. In the German
folk-tales, bathing in the blood of innocent maidens is a cure for
leprosy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3638src" href="#xd21e3638" name=
"xd21e3638src">70</a></p>
<p>The same beliefs largely prevail in India. In 1870, a Musalm&acirc;n
butcher losing his child was told by a Hindu conjuror that if he washed
his wife in the blood of a boy, his next infant would be healthy. To
ensure this result a child was murdered. A similar case occurred in
Muzaffarnagar, where a child was killed and the blood drunk by a barren
woman.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3643src" href="#xd21e3643" name=
"xd21e3643src">71</a> In one of the tales of Somadeva the pregnant
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>queen asks her husband to gratify her longing by
filling a tank with blood for her to bathe in. He was a righteous man,
and in order to gratify her craving he had a tank filled with the juice
of lac and other extracts, so that it seemed to be full of blood. In
another tale the ascetic tells the woman that if she killed her young
son and offered him to the divinity, another son would certainly be
born to her. Quite recently at Muzaffarnagar a childless J&acirc;t
woman was told that she would attain her desire if she bathed in water
mixed with the blood of a Br&acirc;hman child. A Hindu coolie at
Mauritius bathed in and drank the blood of a girl, thinking that
thereby he would be gifted with supernatural powers. It would be easy
to add largely to the number of instances of similar beliefs.<a class=

<p class="first">There are, in addition, numerous customs which appear
to be survivals of human sacrifice, or of the blood covenant, which
also prevailed in Arabia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3656src" href=
"#xd21e3656" name="xd21e3656src">73</a> Among the lower castes in
Northern India the parting of the bride&rsquo;s hair is marked with
red, a survival of the original blood covenant, by which she was
introduced into the sept of her husband. We see that this is the case
from the rites of the more savage tribes. Among the Kewats of Bengal, a
tiny scratch is made on the little finger of the bridegroom&rsquo;s
right hand and of the bride&rsquo;s left, and the drops of blood drawn
from these are mixed with the food. Each then eats the food with which
the other&rsquo;s blood has been mixed. Among the Sant&acirc;ls blood
is drawn in the same way from the little finger of the bride and
bridegroom, and with it marks are made on both above the
clavicle.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3659src" href="#xd21e3659" name=

<p class="first">One standing difficulty at each decennial census has
been the rumour which spreads in remote tracts that Government
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>is making the enumeration with a view of
collecting victims to be sacrificed at some bridge or other building,
or that a toll of pretty girls is to be taken to reward the soldiery
after some war. Thus, about a fort in Madras it had long been a
tradition that when it was first built a girl had been built into the
wall to render it impregnable.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3669src"
href="#xd21e3669" name="xd21e3669src">75</a> It is said that a
R&acirc;ja was once building a bridge over the river Jargo at
Chun&acirc;r, and when it fell down several times he was advised to
sacrifice a Br&acirc;hman girl to the local deity. She has now become
the Mar&icirc; or ghost of the place, and is regularly worshipped in
time of trouble.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3672src" href="#xd21e3672"
name="xd21e3672src">76</a> In Kumaun the same belief prevails, and
kidnappers, known as Dokhutiya, or two-legged beasts of prey, are said
to go about capturing boys for this purpose. In
K&acirc;thi&acirc;w&acirc;r, if a castle was being built and the tower
would not stand, or if a pond had been dug and would not hold water, a
human victim was offered.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3675src" href=
"#xd21e3675" name="xd21e3675src">77</a> The rumour that a victim was
required spread quite recently in connection with the Hughli Bridge at
Calcutta and the Benares water-works. The Narmad&acirc;, it was
believed, would never allow herself to be bridged until she carried
away part of the superstructure, and caused the loss of lives as a
sacrifice. At Ahmad&acirc;b&acirc;d, by the advice of a Br&acirc;hman,
a childless V&acirc;nya was induced to dig a tank to appease the
goddess S&icirc;tal&acirc;. The water refused to enter it without the
sacrifice of a man. As soon as the victim&rsquo;s blood fell on the
ground, the tank filled and the goddess came down from heaven and
rescued the victim.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3678src" href=
"#xd21e3678" name="xd21e3678src">78</a> In building the fort of

daughter of the village headman. When the Shorkot fort was being built
one side repeatedly fell down. A Faq&icirc;r advised the R&acirc;ja to
put a first-born son under the rampart. This was done and the wall
stood. The child&rsquo;s mother went to Mecca, and returned with an
army of Muhammadans; but they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175"

a Faq&icirc;r transformed himself into a cock and flew on the roof of
the palace, where he set up a loud crow. The R&acirc;ja was frightened
and abandoned the place. As he was leaving it, he shouted, &ldquo;Shame
on thee, O Fort! to remain standing!&rdquo; and the walls at once fell
down.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3687src" href="#xd21e3687" name=

<h3 class="main">Modifications of Human Sacrifice.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are also many instances of the transition from
human sacrifices to those of a milder form. Thus, when
Ahmad&acirc;b&acirc;d was building, M&acirc;nik B&acirc;wa, a saint,
every day made a cushion, and every night picked it to pieces. As he
did so the day&rsquo;s work fell down. The Sult&acirc;n refrained from
sacrificing him, but got him into a small jar and kept him there till
the work was over.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3695src" href=
"#xd21e3695" name="xd21e3695src">81</a> The Vill&acirc;lis of
P&ucirc;na on the fifteenth day after a death shape two bricks like
human beings, dress them, and lay them on a wooden stool. They weep by
them all night, and next day, taking them to the burning ground,
cremate them. Among the Telugu Br&acirc;hmans of P&ucirc;na, if a man
dies at an unlucky time, wheaten figures of men are made and burnt with
the corpse. The Konkani Mar&acirc;thas of Kanara on the feast of
Rauln&acirc;th get a man to cut his hand with a knife and let three
drops of blood fall on the ground.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3698src"
href="#xd21e3698" name="xd21e3698src">82</a> Formerly in
Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d, men used to swing themselves from a pole, as
in the famous Bengal Charakh P&ucirc;j&acirc;. In our territories this
is now uncommon, as the village headmen being afraid of responsibility
for an accident, generally, instead of a man, fasten up a white
pumpkin, which they swing about.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3701src"
href="#xd21e3701" name="xd21e3701src">83</a></p>
<p>At the installation of a Bhuiya R&acirc;ja, a man comes forward whom
the R&acirc;ja touches on the neck, as if about to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>cut
off his head. The victim disappears for three days; then he presents
himself before the R&acirc;ja, as if miraculously restored to life.
Similarly, the Gonds, instead of a human sacrifice, now make an image
of straw, which they find answers the purpose. The Bhuiyas of Keunjhar
used to offer the head of their prime minister to Thakur&acirc;n&icirc;
M&acirc;&icirc;. She is now transformed into the Hindu Durg&acirc; and
accepts a sacrifice of goats and sheep.<a class="noteref" id=

Nep&acirc;l, after the Sithi J&acirc;tra feast, the people divide into
two parties and have a match at stone-throwing; formerly this used to
be a serious matter, and any one who was knocked down and fell into the
hands of the other side was sacrificed to the goddess Kankeswar&icirc;.
The actual killing of the victim, as in the case of sacrifices to the
goddess Bachhl&acirc; Dev&icirc;, has now been discontinued under the
influence of British officers.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3711src"

<h3 class="main">Momi&acirc;&icirc;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In connection with human sacrifice may be mentioned
the curious superstition about Momi&acirc;&icirc; or mummy.</p>
<p>The virtues of human fat as a magical ointment appear all through
folk-lore. Othello, referring to the handkerchief which he had given to
Desdemona, says,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;It was dyed in the mummy which the skilful</p>
<p class="line">Conserved of maidens&rsquo; hearts.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Writing of witches Reginald Scot says: &ldquo;The
devil teacheth them to make ointment of the bowels and members of
children, whereby they ride in the air and accomplish all their
desires. After burial they steal them out of their graves and seethe
them in a cauldron till the flesh be made potable, of which they make
an ointment by which they ride in the air.&rdquo; In Macbeth the first
witch speaks of&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Grease that sweaten</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=

<p>Indian witches are believed to use the same mystic preparation to
enable them to fly through the air, as their European sisters are
supposed to use the fat of a toad.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3736src"
href="#xd21e3736" name="xd21e3736src">86</a> Human fat is believed to
be specially efficacious for this purpose. In one of Somadeva&rsquo;s
stories the Br&acirc;hman searches for treasure with a candle made of
human fat in his hand.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3739src" href=
"#xd21e3739" name="xd21e3739src">87</a> One of the Mongol Generals,
Marco Polo tells us, was accused of boiling down human beings and using
their fat to grease his mangonels; and Carpini says that when the
Tartars cast Greek fire into a town they used to shoot human fat with
it, in order to cause the fire to burn more quickly.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3744src" href="#xd21e3744" name="xd21e3744src">88</a> So, in
Europe a candle of human fat is said to have been used by robbers with
the Hand of Glory to prevent the inmates waking, and on the Scotch
border the torch used in the mystic ceremony of &ldquo;saining&rdquo;
was made from the fat of a slaughtered enemy.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3747src" href="#xd21e3747" name="xd21e3747src">89</a></p>
<p>In India, the popular idea about Momi&acirc;&icirc; is that a boy,
the fatter and blacker the better, is caught, a small hole is bored in
the top of his head, and he is hung up by the heels over a slow fire.
The juice or essence of his body is in this way distilled into seven
drops of the potent medicine known as Momi&acirc;&icirc;.</p>
<p>This substance possesses healing properties of a supernatural kind.
Sword cuts, spear thrusts, wounds from arrows and other weapons of
warfare are instantly cured by its use, and he who possesses it is
practically invulnerable. In Kumaun, this substance is known as
N&acirc;r&acirc;yan Tel or R&acirc;m Tel, the &ldquo;oil of Vishnu or
R&acirc;ma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is further believed that a European gentleman, known as the
Momi&acirc;&icirc;-w&acirc;la S&acirc;hib, has a contract from
Government of the right of enticing away suitable boys for this
purpose. He makes them smell a stick or wand, which obliges them to
follow him, and he then packs them off to some hill station where he
carries on this nefarious manufacture.</p>
<p>As an instance of this belief, &ldquo;A very black servant of a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>friend of mine states that he had a very narrow
escape from this S&acirc;hib at the Nauchandi fair at Meerut, where
Government allows him to walk about for one day and make as many
suitable victims as he can by means of his stick. The S&acirc;hib had
just put his hand in his pocket and taken out the stick, which was dry
and shrivelled and about a span long, when the servant with great
presence of mind held out his hands and said, &lsquo;<i>Bas!
Bas!</i>&rsquo; &lsquo;Enough! enough!&rsquo; Thus intimidated, the
S&acirc;hib went away into the crowd. In connection with
Momi&acirc;&icirc;, a lady here narrowly escaped a very uncanny
reputation. Some of her servants gave out that she possessed a
Momi&acirc;&icirc; stick, for which she had paid a hundred rupees. On
hearing this an inquiry was made which brought out that the lady had
missed a pod of vanilla about seven inches long, of a very special
quality, that she kept rolled up in a piece of paper among some of her
trinkets. The ayah who mislaid it was scolded for her carelessness, and
told that it was worth more than she thought. She promptly put two and
two together. The shrivelled appearance which is supposed to be
peculiar to mysterious sticks, such as snake charmers produce, the fuss
made about it, and the value attached to it convinced her that her
mistress owned a Momi&acirc;&icirc; stick.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3764src" href="#xd21e3764" name="xd21e3764src">90</a></p>
<p>These mystic sticks appear constantly in folk-lore. We have the
caduceus of Hermes, the rod of Moses, the staff of Elisha, the wand of
Circe, or of Gwydion or Skirni. In one of Somadeva&rsquo;s tales the
Kap&acirc;lika ascetic has a magic stick which dances. In one of the
Kashm&icirc;r tales the magic wand placed under the feet of the prince
makes him insensible, when laid under his head he revives. Many people
in England still believe in the divining rod which points out concealed
springs underground.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3769src" href=
"#xd21e3769" name="xd21e3769src">91</a></p>
<p>Every native boy, particularly those who are black and fat, believes
himself a possible victim to the wiles of the dreaded
Momi&acirc;&icirc; S&acirc;hib, who frequents hill stations because
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>he is thus enabled to carry on his villainous
practices with comparative impunity and less danger of detection. Even
to whisper the word Momi&acirc;&icirc; is enough to make the crowd of
urchins who dog the steps of a district officer when he is on his
rounds through a town, disperse in dismay. Surgeons are naturally
exposed to the suspicion of being engaged in this awful business, and
some years ago most of the coolies deserted one of the hill stations,
because an enthusiastic anatomist set up a private dissecting-room of
his own. Freemasons, who are looked on by the general native public as
a kind of sorcerers or magicians, are also not free from this
suspicion. That such ideas should prevail among the rural population of
India is not to be wondered at, when in our own modern England it is
very commonly believed that luminous paint is made out of human
fat.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3776src" href="#xd21e3776" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another of these dreaded S&acirc;hibs is the
D&acirc;napurw&acirc;la S&acirc;hib, or gentleman from Dinapur. Why
this personage should be connected with Dinapur, a respectable British
cantonment, no one can make out. At any rate, it is generally believed
that he has a contract from Government for procuring heads for some of
the museums, and he too has a magic stick with which he entices
unfortunate travellers on dark nights and chops off their heads with a
pair of shears. The influence of these magic wands by smelling may
perhaps be associated with the fact that the nose is a spirit entry, as
we have seen in the case of sneezing.</p>

the dream of Jacob, and the Hajuru&rsquo;l Aswad of Mecca, which Sir R.
Burton believed to be an a&euml;rolite. No one will bring a stone from
the Sacred Hill at Govardhan near Mathura, because it is supposed to be
endowed with life. The Y&acirc;davas, who are connected with the same
part of the country, had a stone fetish, described in the Vishnu
Pur&acirc;na, which brought rain and plenty. There are numerous legends
connected with many of these fetish stones, such as that in the temple

great Lingam, and failed to do so even with the aid of elephants. When
he came to investigate the cause of his failure, tongues of flame burst

their title to the estates, which were granted to them by one of the

of which is called Ransila, or &ldquo;the stone of battle,&rdquo; and
is cleft through the centre by a deep, fresh-looking fissure, at right
angles to which is a similar rift in the lower rock. A small boulder on
the top is said to have been the weapon with which Bh&icirc;msen

<h3 class="main">Fetishes among the Sant&acirc;ls.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Sant&acirc;ls, like all uncivilized races, have a
whole army of fetishes. A round piece of wood, nearly a foot in length,
the top of which is painted red, is called Banh&icirc;, or &ldquo;the
protector of the jungle.&rdquo; Another stands for Lagh&ucirc;, the
goddess of the earth, who is sometimes represented by a mountain. An
oblong piece of wood, painted red, stands for
Mah&acirc;m&acirc;&icirc;, &ldquo;the great Mother,&rdquo;
Dev&icirc;&rsquo;s daughter; a small piece of white stone daubed with
red is Burhiy&acirc; M&acirc;&icirc;, or &ldquo;the old Mother,&rdquo;
her granddaughter; an arrow-head stands for D&ucirc;dh&acirc;
M&acirc;&icirc;, &ldquo;the milk Mother,&rdquo; the daughter of
Burhiy&acirc;; a trident painted red represents the monkey god
Hanum&acirc;n, who executes all the orders of Dev&icirc;. &ldquo;Sets
of these symbols are placed, one on the east and one on the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>west of their huts to protect them from evil
spirits, snakes, tigers, and all sorts of misfortune.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3825src" href="#xd21e3825" name=
"xd21e3825src">100</a></p>
<p>Very similar to this is the worship of B&icirc;rn&acirc;th, the
fetish of the Mirzapur Ah&icirc;rs. His platform, which is made of
clay, usually contains one, three, or five rude wooden images, each
about three feet high, with a rough representation of a human face
sculptured on the top. He was, it is said, an Ah&icirc;r who was killed
by a tiger, and he is now worshipped by them in times of trouble. His
special function is to protect the cattle from beasts of prey. The
worshipper bathes, plasters his platform with fresh clay, and laying
his offering on it, says: &ldquo;B&icirc;rn&acirc;th! Keep our cattle
safe and you will get more.&rdquo; The same form of worship prevails
all along the Central Indian Hills. &ldquo;In the south of the
Bhand&acirc;ra District the traveller frequently meets with squared
pieces of wood, each with a rude figure carved in front, set up close
to each other. These represent Bangar&acirc;m, Bangar&acirc;
B&acirc;&icirc;, or Dev&icirc;, who is said to have one sister and five
brothers, the sister being styled K&acirc;l&icirc;, and four out of the
five brothers being known as Gantar&acirc;m, Champar&acirc;m,
N&acirc;ikar&acirc;m, and Potlinga. They are all deemed to possess the
power of sending disease and death upon men, and under these or other
names seem to be generally feared in the region east of N&acirc;gpur.
Bh&icirc;msen, again, is generally adored under the form of one or two
pieces of wood standing three or four feet in length above the ground,
like those set up in connection with Bangar&acirc;m&rsquo;s
worship.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3830src" href="#xd21e3830"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Many of these stones have the power of curing disease,
and the water with which they have been bathed is considered a useful
medicine. This is the case with a number of sacred Mah&acirc;deva
Lingams all over the country. A common proverb speaks of the old woman
who is ready enough to eat the Pras&acirc;d or offering to the god, but
hesitates <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>to drink the water in which his feet have been
washed. In Western India no orthodox Br&acirc;hman will eat his food
till he has thrice sipped the water in which his S&acirc;lagr&acirc;ma
stone has been washed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3840src" href=
"#xd21e3840" name="xd21e3840src">102</a> We have already noticed the
fetish bowl, the washings of which are administered by midwives to
secure easy parturition. So, in Western lands the stones fetched by
Merlin had the power of healing if washed in water and the patient
bathed in it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3843src" href="#xd21e3843"
name="xd21e3843src">103</a> Stone celts are, in Cornwall, supposed to

Isle of Lewis cattle disease is attributed to the bites of serpents,

<h3 class="main">Fetish Stones the Abode of Spirits.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The virtue of all these fetish stones rests in their
embodying the spirits of gods or deified men. As we have shown, this is
a common principle of popular belief. In one of Miss Stokes&rsquo;s
Indian tales, &ldquo;The man who went to seek his fate,&rdquo; the fate
is found in stones, some standing up and some lying down. The man beats
the stone which embodies his fate because he is miserably poor. Mr. H.
Spencer thinks that the idea of persons being turned into stones may
have arisen from instances of actual petrifaction of trees and the
like; but this is not very probable, and it is much simpler to believe
with Dr. Tylor that it depends on the principles of animism.<a class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Some fetishes, like the Bombay Devaks, are special to
particular families. Such is the case with the Th&acirc;rus, a
non-Aryan tribe in the sub-Him&acirc;layan Tar&acirc;&icirc;. Each
member of the tribe constructs a hollow mound in front of his door, and
thereon erects a stake of Pal&acirc;sa wood (<i>Butea frondosa</i>),
which is regarded as the family fetish and periodically worshipped.</p>

<h3 class="main">Tool Fetishes.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Next comes the worship of the tool fetish, which,
according to Sir A. Lyall, is &ldquo;the earliest phase or type of the
tendency which later on leads those of one guild or walk in life to
support and cultivate one god, who is elected in lieu of the individual
trade fetishes melted down to preside over their craft or trade
interests.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3880src" href="#xd21e3880"
name="xd21e3880src">108</a></p>
<p>A good example of this is the pickaxe fetish of the Thags.</p>
<p>When K&acirc;l&icirc; refused to help them in the burial of their
victims she gave them one of her teeth for a pickaxe, and the hem of
her lower garment for a noose. Hence the pickaxe was venerated by the
Thags. Its fabrication was superintended with the utmost care, and it
was consecrated with many ceremonies. A lucky day was selected, and a
smith was appointed to forge it with the most profound secrecy. The
door was closed against all intruders; the leader never left the forge
while the manufacture was going on; and the smith was allowed to do no
other work until this was completed. Next came the consecration. This
was done on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday, and care was taken
that the shadow of no living thing fell upon the axe. The consecrator
sat with his face to the west, and received the implement in a brass
dish. It was then washed in water which was allowed to fall into a pit
made for the purpose. Then further ablutions followed, the first in
sugar and water, the second in sour milk, and the third in spirits. The
axe was then marked from the head to the point with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>seven spots of red lead, and replaced on the
brass dish with a cocoanut, some cloves, white sandalwood, and other
articles.</p>
<p>A fire was next made of cowdung and the wood of the Mango and Ber
tree. All the articles deposited on the brass plate, with the exception
of the cocoanut, were thrown into the fire, and when the flame rose the
Thag priest passed the pickaxe with both hands seven times through the
fire. The cocoanut was then stripped of its husk and placed on the
ground. The officiant, holding the axe by the point, asked:
&ldquo;Shall I strike?&rdquo; The bystanders assented, and he then
broke the cocoanut with the blunt end of the weapon, exclaiming,
&ldquo;All hail, Dev&icirc;! Great Mother of us all!&rdquo; The
spectators responded, &ldquo;All hail, Dev&icirc;, and prosper the
Thags.&rdquo; If the cocoanut was not broken at one blow, all the
labour was lost; the goddess was considered unpropitious, and the
entire ceremony had to be repeated. The broken shell and kernel of the
cocoanut were then thrown into the fire, the pickaxe wrapt in white
cloth was placed on the ground towards the west, and all present
prostrated themselves before it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3891src"
href="#xd21e3891" name="xd21e3891src">109</a></p>
<p>Here we have another example of magic in its sympathetic form, the
use of sundry spirit scarers, which have been already discussed, and
the cocoanut representing an actual human victim.</p>

<h3 class="main">Weapons and Implement Fetishes.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the same way soldiers and warlike tribes worship
their weapons. Thus, the sword was worshipped by the R&acirc;jputs, and
when a man of lower caste married a R&acirc;jput girl, she was married,
as in the case of Holkar, to his sword with his kerchief bound round
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3901src" href="#xd21e3901" name=
"xd21e3901src">110</a> This sword-worship is specially performed, as by
the Baisw&acirc;rs of Mirzapur and the Gautam sept of R&acirc;jputs.
The Nep&acirc;lese worship their weapons and regimental colours at the
Dasahra festival. At the Diw&acirc;l&icirc;, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>or
feast of lamps, on the first day they worship dogs; on the second day
cows and bulls; on the third day capitalists worship their treasure
under the name of Lakshm&icirc;, the goddess of wealth; on the fourth
day every householder worships as deities the members of his family,
and on the fifth day sisters worship their brothers.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3906src" href="#xd21e3906" name="xd21e3906src">111</a></p>
<p>The same customs prevail among the artisan castes in Northern India.
The hair-scraper of the tanner is worshipped by curriers, and the
potter&rsquo;s wheel, regarded as a type of productiveness, is
reverenced at marriages by many of the lower castes. Even the clay
which has been mixed by the potter has mystic powers. When a person has
been bitten by a mad dog, a lump of this clay is brought, and the wound
is touched with it while a spell is recited.<a class="noteref" id=

worship their yard measure; Cham&acirc;rs swear by the
shoemaker&rsquo;s last, and the children of the Darzi or tailor are
made to worship the scissors.</p>
<p>In Bengal, the Alakhiya sect of Saiva ascetics profess profound
respect for their alms-bag; the carpenters worship their adze, chisel,
and saw; the barbers their razors, scissors, and mirror. At the
Sr&icirc;pancham&icirc;, or fifth day of the month of M&acirc;gh, the
writer class worship their books, pens, and inkstand. The writing
implements are cleaned, and the books, wrapped in white cloth, are
strewn over with flowers and the leaves of young barley.<a class=

<p>The same customs prevail in Bombay. A mill is the Devak or guardian
of oil-makers; dancing girls worship a musical instrument; jewellers

gardeners a pair of scales.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3921src" href=

<p>In the Panj&acirc;b, farmers worship their oxen in August, their

October to drive away ticks from their cattle; shepherds worship their
sheep at the full moon of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href=

their books at the Diw&acirc;l&icirc; festival; grain-sellers worship
their weights at the Dasahra, Diw&acirc;l&icirc;, and Hol&icirc;, and,
in a way, every morning as well. Oilmen worship their presses at odd
times; artisans salute their tools daily when they bathe; and generally
the means of livelihood, whatever they may be, are worshipped with

<p>Among these implement fetishes the corn-sieve and the plough, the

<h3 class="main">The Corn-sieve.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The corn-sieve or winnowing basket, the <i>Mystica
vannus Iacchi</i> of Virgil, has always enjoyed a reputation as an
emblem of increase and prosperity, and as possessing magical powers.
The witch in Macbeth says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Her husband&rsquo;s to Aleppo gone, Master of
the <i>Tiger</i>;</p>
<p class="line">But in a sieve I&rsquo;ll thither sail.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It was used in Scotland to foretell the future at
Allhallow Eve. Divination was performed with a pair of shears and a
sieve. Aubrey describes how &ldquo;the shears are stuck in a sieve, and
the maidens hold up the sieve with the top of their fingers by the
handle of the shears, then say, &lsquo;By St. Peter and St. Paul, he
hath not stolen it.&rsquo; After many adjurations the sieve will turn
at the name of the thief.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3964src"
href="#xd21e3964" name="xd21e3964src">118</a></p>
<p>In India the sieve is the first cradle of the baby, and in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>Bombay the winnowing fan in which a newly-born
child is laid is used on the fifth day for the worship of
Satv&acirc;&icirc;. This makes it impure, and it is henceforward used
only for the house sweepings. In Northern India, when a mother has lost
a child, she puts the next in a sieve and drags it about, calling it
Kadheran or Ghas&icirc;tan, &ldquo;the dragged one,&rdquo; so as to
baffle the Evil Eye by a pretence of contempt.</p>
<p>All through Upper India, at low-caste marriages, the bride&rsquo;s
brother accompanies the pair as they revolve in the marriage shed, and
sprinkles parched grain over them out of a sieve as a charm for good
luck and a means of scaring the demon which causes barrenness. So Irish
brides in old times used to be followed by two attendants bearing high
over the heads of the couple a sieve filled with meal, a sign of the
plenty that would be in the house, and an omen of good luck and the
blessing of children.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3973src" href=
"#xd21e3973" name="xd21e3973src">119</a> We have already seen that this
rite survives in the custom of flinging rice over the newly-married
pair as they leave for the honeymoon.</p>
<p>This habit of scaring the spirits of evil by means of the sieve
appears in a special usage at the Diw&acirc;l&icirc; festival. Very
early in the morning the house-mother takes a sieve and a broom, and
beats them in every corner of the house, exclaiming, &ldquo;God abide,
and poverty depart!&rdquo; The fan is then carried outside the village,
generally to the east or north, and being thrown away, is supposed,
like the scapegoat, to bear away with it the poverty and distress of
the household. The same custom prevails in Germany. The Posterli is
imagined to be a spectre in the shape of an old woman. In the evening
the young fellows of the village assemble, and with loud shouts and
clashing of tins, ringing of cow-bells and goat-bells, and cracking of
whips, tramp over hill and dale to another village, where the young men
receive them with like uproar. One of the party represents the
Posterli, or they draw it in a sledge in the shape of a puppet, and
leave it standing in a corner of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>other village. In the
same way the Eskimo drive the demon Tuna out of their houses.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3980src" href="#xd21e3980" name=
"xd21e3980src">120</a></p>
<p>Among the Kols, when a vacancy occurs in the office of the village
priest, the winnowing fan with some rice is used, and by its magical
power it drags the person who holds it towards the individual on whom
the sacred mantle has fallen. The same custom prevails among the
Or&acirc;ons.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3985src" href="#xd21e3985"
name="xd21e3985src">121</a></p>
<p>The Greeks had a special name, Koskinomantis, for the man who
divined in this way with the sieve, and the practice is mentioned by
Theocritus.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3990src" href="#xd21e3990" name=
"xd21e3990src">122</a> The sieve is very commonly used in India as a
rude form of the planchette. Through the wicker-work of the raised side
or back a strong T-shaped twig is fixed, one end of which rests on the
finger. A question is asked, and according as the sieve turns to the
right or left, the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
This is exactly what is known as &ldquo;Cauff-riddling&rdquo; in
Yorkshire and Scotland.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3993src" href=
"#xd21e3993" name="xd21e3993src">123</a> In the eastern districts of
the North-Western Provinces, when the Ojha or &ldquo;cunning man&rdquo;
is called in to cure disease, or possession by evil spirits, he puts
some sesamum into a sieve, shakes it about, and then proceeds to
identify the ghost concerned by counting the number of grains which
remain stuck between the reeds. At a Sant&acirc;l cremation, a man
takes his seat near the ashes, and tosses rice on them with a winnowing
fan till a frenzy appears to seize him, and he becomes inspired and
says wonderful things.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3996src" href=
"#xd21e3996" name="xd21e3996src">124</a></p>
<p>It is one of the curiosities of comparative folk-lore that this
instrument should be credited with magical powers all over two
continents.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4004src" href="#xd21e4004" name=
"xd21e4004src">125</a></p>
<p>The winnowing basket, again, perhaps from its association,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>like the winnowing fan, with the sacred grain,
has mystic powers. In Scotland it was used in the rite of creeling as a
means of scaring barrenness. &ldquo;The young wedded pair, with their
friends, assemble in a convenient spot. A small creel or basket is
prepared for the occasion, into which they put some stones; the young
men carry it alternately, and allow themselves to be caught by the
maidens, who have a kiss when they succeed. After a great deal of
innocent mirth and pleasantry, the creel falls at length to the young
husband&rsquo;s share, who is obliged generally to carry it for a long
time, none of the young women having compassion upon him. At length his
fair mate kindly relieves him from his burden; and her complaisance, in
this particular, is considered as a proof of her satisfaction at the
choice she has made.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4014src" href=
"#xd21e4014" name="xd21e4014src">126</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Bengal, at the full moon immediately following the Durg&acirc;
P&ucirc;j&acirc;, the festival of Lakshm&icirc;, the goddess of wealth,
is held. In every Hindu house a basket, which serves as the
representative of prosperity, is set up and worshipped. This basket, or
corn measure, is filled with paddy, encircled with a garland of
flowers, and covered with a piece of cloth. They sit up all night and
watch for Lakshm&icirc; to arrive, and any negligence in watching is
believed to bring misfortune on the family.<a class="noteref" id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The same idea applies to the broom used in sweeping
the house or collecting the grain on the threshing-floor. We have
already seen the use of it to drive out poverty. &ldquo;Pythagoras
warned his followers against stepping over a broom. In some parts of
Bavaria, housemaids in sweeping out the house are careful not to step
over the broom for fear of the witches. Again, it is a Bavarian rule
not to step over a broom while a confinement is taking place in a
house; otherwise the birth will be tedious, and the child will always
remain small with a large head. But if anyone <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>has
stepped over a broom inadvertently, he can undo the spell by stepping
backwards over it again.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4030src"
href="#xd21e4030" name="xd21e4030src">128</a> So, in Bombay, they say
you should never step over a broom, or you will cause a woman to suffer
severely in childbed.</p>
<p>In Bombay, some old Hindu woman, to cure a child affected by the
Evil Eye, waves salt and water round its face and strikes the ground
with a broom three times; and among the Bani Isr&acirc;&icirc;ls of
Bombay, when the midwife drives off the blast of the Evil Eye, she
holds in her left hand a shoe, a winnowing fan, and a broom.<a class=

against sorcery. The Beriyas, a gypsy tribe of the Ganges-Jumna
Du&acirc;b, drive off the disease demon with a broom. In Oudh, it is
said, when a broomstick has been done with, it should always be laid
down, and not left standing. Mah&acirc;-Br&acirc;hmans, who gain by

the child is first fed with grain. And there is a regular worship of it
in the month of Bais&acirc;kh, or May. The top is smeared with red
lead, anointed with oil, and offerings of rice and holy D&ucirc;rva
grass made to it. The worship has even been provided with a
Br&acirc;hmanical legend. A Guru once ordered his disciple to pronounce
the word Dhenk at least one hundred and eight times a day. N&acirc;rada

<p class="first">Next comes the plough as a fetish. The carrying about
of the plough and the prohibition common in Europe against moving it on
Shrove Tuesday and other holidays have, like many other images of the
same class, been connected with Phallicism.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4056src" href="#xd21e4056" name="xd21e4056src">132</a> But,
considering the respect which an agricultural people would naturally
pay to the chief implement used in husbandry, it is simpler to class it
with the other tool fetishes of a similar kind. In India, as in Europe
on Plough Monday,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4059src" href="#xd21e4059"
name="xd21e4059src">133</a> there is a regular worship of the plough at
the end of the sowing season, when the beam is coloured with turmeric,
adorned with garlands, and brought home from the field in triumph.
After that day it is considered unlucky to use it or lend it. The beam
is put up in the village cattle track when rinderpest is about, as a
charm to drive away the disease. Among some castes the polished share
is fixed up in the marriage shed during the ceremony. Among the
Or&acirc;ons, the bride and bridegroom are made to stand on a curry
stone, under which is placed a sheaf of corn resting on the plough
yoke, and among the same people their god Darha is represented by a
plough-share set upon an altar dedicated to him.<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Fire is undoubtedly a very ancient Hindu protective
fetish, and its virtue as a scarer of demons is very generally
recognized. One of the earliest legends of the Hindu race is that
recorded in the Rig Veda, where Agni, the god of fire, concealed
himself in heaven, was brought down to earth by M&acirc;tarisvan, and
made over to the princely tribe of Bhrigu, in which we have the
Oriental version of the myth of Prometheus. In the Vedas, Agni ranks
next to the Rain god, and takes precedence of every other god in
connection <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>with sacrificial rites. Even the Sun godling is
regarded as a form of the heavenly fire. One of the titles of Agni is
Pramantha, because on each <span class="corr" id="xd21e4075" title=
"Source: occason">occasion</span> when he was required he was summoned
by the friction of the Aran&icirc;, or sacred fire-drill. This word
Pramantha is probably the equivalent of the Prometheus of the
Greeks.</p>

<h3 class="main">Origin of Fire-worship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">According to Dr. Tylor, &ldquo;the real and absolute
worship of fire falls into two great divisions, the first belonging to
fetishism, the second to polytheism proper, and the two apparently
representing an earlier and later stage of theological ideas. The first
is the rude, barbarous adoration of the actual flame which he watches
writhing, devouring, roaring like a wild animal; the second belongs to
an advanced generalization that any individual fire is a manifestation
of one general elemental being, the fire god.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4088src" href="#xd21e4088" name="xd21e4088src">135</a> In a
tropical country it would naturally be associated with the worship of
the sun, and with that of the sainted dead as the medium by which the
spirit wings its way to the other world. Among many races fire is
provided for the ghost after interment, to enable it to warm itself and
cook its food. As Mr. Spencer points out, the grave fire would tend to
develop into kindred religious rites.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">The Sacred Fire.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But it is almost certainly erroneous to class the
sacred fire as an institution peculiar to the so-called Aryan races.
The Homa is, of course, one of the most important elements of the
modern Hindu ritual; but at the same time it prevails extensively as a
means of propitiating the local or village godlings among many of the
Dr&acirc;vidian races, who are quite as likely to have discovered for
themselves the mystical art of fire production by mechanical means, as
to have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>adopted it by a process of conscious or
unconscious imitation from the usages of their Hindu neighbours.</p>
<p>The production of fire by means of friction is a discovery which
would naturally occur to jungle races, who must have constantly seen it
occur by the ignition of the bamboo stalks rubbed together by the
blasts of summer. From this would easily be developed the very
primitive fire-drill or Asgara, used to this day by the Cheros, Korwas,
Bhuiyas and other Dr&acirc;vidian dwellers in the jungle. These people
even to the present day habitually produce fire in this way. A small
round cavity is made in a dry piece of bamboo, in which two men
alternately with their open hands revolve a second pointed piece of the
wood of the same tree. Smoke and finally fire are rapidly produced in
this way, and the sparks are received on a dry leaf or other suitable
tinder. The use of the flint and steel is also common, and was possibly
an early and independent invention of the same people. Even to the
present day in some of their more secret worship of the village
godlings of disease, fire is produced for the fire sacrifice by this
primitive method.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Fire-drill.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What has been called the Aryan fire-drill, the
Aran&icirc;, which in one sense means &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; or
&ldquo;strange,&rdquo; and in another &ldquo;moving&rdquo; or
&ldquo;entering,&rdquo; &ldquo;being inserted,&rdquo; is not apparently
nowadays used in the ordinary ritual for the production of fire for the
Homa or fire sacrifice. The rites connected with the sacred fire have
been given in detail in another place.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4108src" href="#xd21e4108" name="xd21e4108src">137</a> In
Northern India, at least, the production of the sacred fire has become
the speciality of one branch of the Br&acirc;hmans, the Gujar&acirc;ti,
who are employed to conduct certain special services occasionally
conducted at large cost by wealthy devotees, and known as Jag or
Yaksha, in the sense of some particular religious rite.</p>
<p>The Aran&icirc; in its modern form consists of five pieces. The
Adhararan&icirc; is the lower bed of the instrument, and is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>usually made of the hard wood of the Khadira or
Khair&mdash;Acacia catechu. In this are bored two shallow holes, one,
the Garta, a small shallow round cavity, in which the plunger or
revolving drill works and produces fire by friction. Close to this is a
shallow oblong cavity, known as the Yon&icirc; or matrix, in which
combustible tinder, generally the husk of the cocoanut, is placed, and
in which the sparks and heated ashes are received and ignited. The
upper or revolving portion of the drill is known as Uttararan&icirc; or
Pramantha. This consists of two parts, the upper portion a piece of
hard, round wood which one priest revolves with a rope or cord known as
Netra. This part of the implement is known as Mantha or &ldquo;the
churner.&rdquo; It has a socket at the base in which the Sanku, a spike
or dart, is fixed. This Sanku is made of a softer wood, generally that
of the P&icirc;pal, or sacred fig tree, than the Adhararan&icirc; or
base; and each Aran&icirc; is provided with several spare pieces of fig
wood for the purpose of replacing the Sanku, as it becomes gradually
charred away by friction. The last piece is the Upamantha or upper
churner, which is a flat board with a socket. This is pressed down by
one priest, so as to force the Sanku deep and hard into the Garta or
lower cavity, and to increase the resistance.</p>
<p>The working of the implement thus requires the labour of two
priests, one of whom presses down the plunger, and the other who
revolves the drill rapidly by means of the rope. It is not easy to
obtain specimens of the implement, which is regarded as possessing
mystical properties, and the production of the sacred fire is always
conducted in secret.</p>
<p>We have in one of the African folk-tales a reference to the
production of the fire by friction, in which the hy&aelig;na gets his
ear burnt.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4119src" href="#xd21e4119" name=
"xd21e4119src">138</a> In one of the tales of Somadeva we read,
&ldquo;Then the Br&acirc;hman blessed the king and said to him,
&lsquo;I am a Br&acirc;hman named N&acirc;ga Sarman, and bear the
fruit, I hope, from my sacrifice. When the god of fire is pleased with
this Vilva sacrifice, then Vilva fruits of gold will come out of the
fire cavity. Then the god of fire will appear in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>bodily form, and grant me a boon, and so I have
spent much time in offering Vilva fruits.&rsquo; Then the seven-rayed
god appeared from the sacrificial cavity, bringing the king a golden
Vilva fruit of his tree of valour.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4124src" href="#xd21e4124" name="xd21e4124src">139</a></p>
<p>The Agnikunda, the hole or enclosed space for the sacred fire, out
of which, according to the popular legend, various R&acirc;jput tribes
were produced, is thus probably derived from the Garta or pit out of
which the sparks fly in the fire-drill.</p>
<p>The Agnihotri Br&acirc;hman has to take particular care to preserve
the germ of the sacred fire, as did the Roman vestal virgins. It is in
charge of the special guardians at some shrines, such as those of
Sambhun&acirc;th and Kharg Jogin&icirc; at Nep&acirc;l.<a class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But it is not only in the Hindu ritual that the sacred
fire holds a prominent place. Thus, in ancient Ireland, the sacred fire
was obtained by the friction of wood and the striking of stones, and it
was supposed &ldquo;that the spirits of fire dwelt in these objects,
and when the priests invoked them to appear, they brought good luck to
the household for the coming year, but if invoked by other hands on
that special day, their influence was malific.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4139src" href="#xd21e4139" name="xd21e4139src">141</a></p>
<p>So, among the Muhammadans in the time of Akbar, &ldquo;at noon of
the day when the sun enters the 19th degree of Aries, the whole world
being surrounded by the light, they expose a round piece of a white
shining stone, called in Hindi S&ucirc;rajkrant.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4144src" href="#xd21e4144" name="xd21e4144src">142</a> A piece of
cotton is then held near it, which catches fire from the heat of the
stone. The celestial fire is committed to the care of proper
persons.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4147src" href="#xd21e4147"
name="xd21e4147src">143</a> Perhaps <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>the best example of
the Muhammadan sacred fire is that at the Im&acirc;mb&acirc;ra at
Gorakhpur. There it was first started by a renowned Shiah Faq&icirc;r,
named Roshan &rsquo;Ali, and has been maintained unquenched for more
than a hundred years, a special body of attendants and supplies of wood
being provided for it. There seems little reason to believe that the
fire is a regular Muhammadan institution; it has probably arisen from
an imitation of the customs of the Hindu Jogis.</p>
<p>It is respected both by Hindus and Musalm&acirc;ns, and as in the
case of the fires of the same kind, maintained by many noted Jogis, its
ashes have a reputation as a cure for fever. We shall meet with the
same belief of the curative effects of the ashes of the sacred fire in
the case of the Hol&icirc;. The ashes of the Jogi&rsquo;s fire form a
part of many popular charms. In Italy, the holy log burnt on Christmas
Eve, which corresponds to the Yule log of the North of Europe, is taken
with due observances to the Faunus, or other spirits of the
forest.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4154src" href="#xd21e4154" name=

<p>The meteoric light or Shah&acirc;ba is also much respected. In

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=

where the bodies of those slain in battle are interred, it is said that

tethered, and lovely girls dance before the heroes and the Jinn who are
in their train. Sometimes some foolish mortal is attracted by the
spectacle, and he suffers for his foolhardiness by loss of life or
reason. Sometimes these ignes fatui mislead the traveller at night, as
Robin Goodfellow &ldquo;misleads night wanderers, laughing at their

<p class="first">Next comes the respect paid to the cairn which covers
the remains of the dead or is a mere cenotaph commemorating a death. We
have already seen instances of this in the pile of stones which marks
the place where a tiger has killed a man, and in the cairns in honour
of the jungle deities, or the spirits which infest dangerous passes.
The rationale of these sepulchral cairns is to keep down the ghost of
the dead man and prevent it from injuring the living. We see the same
idea in the rule of the old ritual, that on the departure of the last
mourner, after the conclusion of the funeral ceremony, the
Adhv&acirc;ryu, or officiating priest, should place a circle of stones
behind him, to prevent death overtaking those who have gone in

similar tomb is smeared with turmeric and lime, and people offer
cocoanuts to it in the hope of getting increased produce from their
fields. The tomb of an English officer near the Fort of Bijaygarh in
the Aligarh District was, when I visited the place some years ago,
revered as the shrine of the local village godling. There is a similar
case at R&acirc;walpindi. There is a current tale of some people

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Origin of Animal-worship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We now come to consider the special worship of certain
animals. The origin of this form of belief may possibly be traced to
many different sources.</p>
<p>In the first place, no savage fixes the boundary line between man
and the lower forms of animal life so definitely as more civilized
races are wont to do. The animal, in their belief, has very much the
same soul, much the same feelings and passion as men have, a theory
exemplified in the way the Indian ploughman speaks to his ox, or the
shepherd calls his flock.</p>
<p>To him, again, the belief is familiar that the spirits of his
ancestors appear in the form of animals, as among the Dr&acirc;vidian
races they come in the shape of a tiger which attacks the surviving
relatives, or as a chicken which leaves the mark of its footsteps in
the ashes when it re-visits its former home.</p>
<p>So, all these people believe that the witch soul wanders about at
night, and for want of a better shape enters into some animal, takes
the form of a tiger or a bear, or flies through the air like a
bird.</p>
<p>All through folk-lore we find the idea that man has kinship
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>with animals generally accepted. We constantly
find the girl wooed by the frog, marrying the pigeon, elephant, eagle,
or whale. Every child in the nursery reads of the frog Prince, and no
savage sees any particular incongruity in his marriage and
transformation. In more than one of the Indian tales the childless wife
longs for a child and is delivered of a snake.</p>
<p>The incident of animal metamorphosis is also familiar. Thus, in one
of Somadeva&rsquo;s tales his mistress turns a man into an ox; in
another his wife transforms him into a buffalo; in a third the angry
hermit turns the king into an elephant.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4301src" href="#xd21e4301" name="xd21e4301src">1</a> Everyone
remembers the terrific scene of transformation into various animals
which makes up the tale of the second Qalandar in the Arabian Nights.
Animals, too, constantly assume other shapes. In one of the Bengal
stories the mouse becomes a cat. In other Indian tales the golden deer
becomes the mannikin demon, the white hind becomes the white witch, the
hero&rsquo;s mother becomes a black bitch, the hero himself a parrot,
and so on.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4304src" href="#xd21e4304" name=
"xd21e4304src">2</a> In fact a large part of the incidents of Indian
stories turns on various forms of metamorphosis, and every English
child knows how the lover of Earl Mar&rsquo;s daughter took the shape
of a dove.</p>
<p>We have again the very common incident in the folk-tales of animals
understanding the speech of human beings, and men learning the tongue
of birds, and the like. Solomon, according to the Qur&acirc;n, knew the
language of animals; in the tales of Somadeva, the Vaisya
Bh&acirc;sh&acirc;jna knows the language of all beasts and birds, a
faculty which in Germany is gained by eating a white snake.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4309src" href="#xd21e4309" name=
"xd21e4309src">3</a></p>
<p>Then there is the large cycle of tales in which the grateful animal
warns the hero or heroine of approaching danger, as in the story of
Bopuluchi, or brings news, or produces gold. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>The
idea of grateful animals assisting their benefactors runs through the
whole range of folk-lore.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4322src" href=
"#xd21e4322" name="xd21e4322src">4</a></p>
<p>Another series of cognate ideas has been very carefully analyzed by
Mr. Campbell. The spirits of the dead haunt two places, the house and
the tomb. Those who haunt the house are friendly; those who haunt the
tomb are unfriendly. Two classes of animals correspond to these two
classes of spirits&mdash;an at-home, fearless class, as the snake, the
rat, flies and ants and bees, into which the home-haunting or friendly
spirits would go; and a wild, unsociable class, such as bats and owls,
dogs, jackals, or vultures, into which the unfriendly or tomb-haunting
spirits would go. In the case of some of these tomb-haunting animals,
the dog, jackal, and vulture, the feeling towards them as tomb-haunters
seems to have given place to the belief that as the spirit lives in the
tomb where the body is laid, so, if the body be eaten by an animal, the
spirit lives in the animal, as in a living tomb.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4333src" href="#xd21e4333" name="xd21e4333src">5</a></p>
<p>Other animals, again, are invested with particular qualities,
fierceness and courage, strength or agility, and eating part of their
flesh, or wearing a portion as an amulet, conveys to the possessor the
qualities of the animal. A familiar instance of this is the belief in
the claws and flesh of the tiger as amulets or charms against disease
and the influence of evil spirits.</p>
<p>Many animals, too, are respected for their use to man or as scarers
of demons, as the cow; as possessors of wisdom, like the elephant or
snake; as semi-human in origin or character, as the ape. But it is,
perhaps, dangerous to attempt, as Mr. Campbell has done, to push the
classification much farther, because the respect paid to any particular
animal is possibly based on varied and diverging lines of belief.</p>
<p>Lastly, as Mr. Frazer has shown, many animals are regarded
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>as representing the Corn spirit, and are either
revered or killed in their divine forms to promote the return of
vegetation with each recurring spring.</p>

<h3 class="main">Horse-worship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To illustrate some of these principles from the
worship of certain special animals, we may begin with the horse.</p>
<p>War horses were so highly prized by the early Aryans in their
battles with the aborigines, that the horse, under the name of
Dadhikra, &ldquo;he that scatters the hoar frost like milk,&rdquo; soon
became an object of worship, and in the Veda we have a spirited account
of the worship paid to this godlike being.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4352src" href="#xd21e4352" name="xd21e4352src">6</a></p>
<p>Another horse often spoken of in the early legends is Sy&acirc;ma
Karna, &ldquo;he with the black ears,&rdquo; which alone was considered
a suitable victim in the horse sacrifice or Asvamedha. One hundred
horse sacrifices entitled the sacrificer to displace Indra from heaven,
so the deity was always trying to capture the horse which was allowed
to roam about before immolation. The saint G&acirc;lava, who was a
pupil of Visvamitra, when he had completed his studies, asked his tutor
what fee he should pay. The saint told him that he charged no fee, but
he insisted in asking, till at last the angry Rishi said that he would
be content with nothing less than a thousand black-eared horses. After
long search G&acirc;lava found three childless R&acirc;jas, who had
each two hundred such horses, and they consented to exchange them for
sons. G&acirc;lava then went to Yay&acirc;ti, whose daughter could bear
a son for any one and still remain a virgin. By her means the three
R&acirc;jas became fathers of sons, Visvamitra took them, and to make
up the number, had himself two sons by the same mystic bride.</p>
<p>In the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata, Uchchaihsravas, &ldquo;he with the
long ears,&rdquo; or &ldquo;he that neighs loudly,&rdquo; is the king
of the horses, and belongs to Indra. He is swift as thought, follows
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>path of the sun, and is luminous and white, with
a black tail, made so by the magic of the serpents, who have covered it
with black hair. In the folk-tales he consorts with mares of mortal
birth, and begets steeds of unrivalled speed, like the divine Homeric
coursers of &AElig;neas.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4361src" href=
"#xd21e4361" name="xd21e4361src">7</a> In the tales of Somadeva we find
the king addressing his faithful horse, and praying for his aid in
danger, as Achilles speaks to his steeds Xanthos and Balios, and in the
Karling legend of Bayard.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4364src" href=
"#xd21e4364" name="xd21e4364src">8</a> We meet also with the horse of
Manidatta, which was &ldquo;white as the moon; the sound of its
neighing was as musical as that of a clear conch or other
sweet-sounding instrument; it looked like the waves of the sea of milk
surging on high; it was marked with curls on the neck, and adorned with
the crest jewels, the bracelet, and other signs, which it seemed it had
acquired by being born in the race of Gandharvas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a later mythological stage we meet Kalki, the white horse which
is to be the last Avat&acirc;ra of Vishnu, and reminds us of the white
horse of the Book of Revelation. We meet in the Rig Veda with
Yatudhanas, the demon horse, which feeds now upon human flesh (like the
Bucephalus of the legend of Alexander), now upon horseflesh, and now
upon milk from cows. He has a host of brethren, such as Arvan, half
horse, half bird, on which the Daityas are supposed to ride. Dadhyanch
or Dadh&icirc;cha has a curious legend. He was a Rishiand. Indra, after
teaching him the sciences, threatened to cut his head off if he
communicated the knowledge to any one else. But the Aswins tempted him
to disobey the god, and then, to save him from the wrath of Indra, cut
off his head and replaced it with that of a horse. Finally Indra found
his horse-head in the lake at Kurukshetra, and using it as Sampson did
the jaw-bone of the ass, he slew the Asuras. We have, again, Vishnu in
the form of Hayagr&icirc;va, or &ldquo;horse-necked,&rdquo; which he
assumed to save <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206"
name="pb206">206</a>]</span>the Veda, carried off by two Asuras, and in
another shape he is Hayasiras or Hayas&icirc;rsha, which vomits forth
fire and drinks up the waters. In the Pur&acirc;nas we meet the Daitya
Kesi, who assumes the form of a horse and attacks Krishna, but the hero
thrusts his hand into his mouth and rends him asunder. A large chapter
of Scottish folk-lore depends on the doings of magic horses such as
these.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4374src" href="#xd21e4374" name=
"xd21e4374src">9</a></p>
<p>The flying horse of the Arabian Nights has been transferred into
many of the current folk-tales, and has found its way into European
folk-lore.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4379src" href="#xd21e4379" name=
"xd21e4379src">10</a> In the same connection we meet the magic bridle;
the flying car, such as Pushpaka, the flying vehicle of Kuvera, the god
of wealth; the flying bed, the Ur&acirc;n Khatola of the Indian tales;
the flying boat, and the flying shoes.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4382src" href="#xd21e4382" name="xd21e4382src">11</a></p>
<p>There are numerous other horses famous in Hindu legend. The saint
Alam Sayyid of Baroda was known as Ghor&ecirc; K&acirc; P&icirc;r, or
the horse saint. His horse was buried near him, and Hindus hang images
of the animal on trees round his tomb.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4399src" href="#xd21e4399" name="xd21e4399src">12</a> We have
already spoken of G&ucirc;ga and his mare Jav&acirc;diy&acirc;. The
horse of the king of Bhilsa or Bhadr&acirc;vat&icirc; was of dazzling
brightness, and regarded as the palladium of the kingdom, but in spite
of all the care bestowed upon it, it was carried off by the
P&acirc;ndavas.</p>
<p>There is a stock horse miracle story told in connection with
L&acirc;l Beg, the patron saint of the sweepers. The king of Delhi lost
a valuable horse, and the sweepers were ordered to bury it, but as the
animal was very fat, they proceeded to cut it up for themselves, giving
one leg to the king&rsquo;s priest. They took the meat home and
proceeded to cook it, but being short of salt, they sent an old woman
to buy some. She went to the salt merchant&rsquo;s shop and pressed him
to serve her at once, &ldquo;If you do not hurry,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;a thousand rupees&rsquo; worth of meat will be ruined.&rdquo; He
informed the king, who, suspecting the state of the case, ordered the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>sweepers to produce the horse. They were in
dismay at the order, but they laid what was left of the animal on a
mound sacred to L&acirc;l Beg, and prayed to him to save them,
whereupon the horse stood up, but only on three legs. So they went to
the king and confessed how they had disposed of the fourth leg. The
unlucky priest was executed, and the horse soon after died
also.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4406src" href="#xd21e4406" name=
"xd21e4406src">13</a></p>
<p>The horse is regarded as a lucky and exceedingly pure animal. When a
cooking vessel has become in any way <span class="corr" id="xd21e4411"
title="Source: denied">defiled</span>, a common way of purifying it is
to make a horse smell it. In the Dakkhin it is said that evil spirits
will not approach a horse for fear of his foam.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4414src" href="#xd21e4414" name="xd21e4414src">14</a> In Northern
India, the entry of a man on horseback into a sugar-cane field during
sowing time is regarded as auspicious. This taking of omens from horses
was well known in Germany, and Tacitus says, &ldquo;<i lang=

fremitus observant</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4420src"
href="#xd21e4420" name="xd21e4420src">15</a> There does not appear to

has the power of seeing ghosts, or that it can cure diseases such as
whooping cough.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4423src" href="#xd21e4423"
name="xd21e4423src">16</a> But, like the bull, the stallion is believed
to scare the demon of barrenness. In the R&acirc;m&acirc;yana,
Kausaly&acirc; touches the stallion in the hope of obtaining sons, and
with the same object the king and queen smell the odour of the burnt
marrow or fat of the horse. The water in which a fish is washed has the
same effect on women in Western folk-lore. With the same object, at the
Asvamedha, the queen lies at night beside the slain sacrificial
horse.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4427src" href="#xd21e4427" name=

<p>It is popularly supposed that the horse originally had wings, and
that the chestnuts or scars on the legs are the places where the wings
originally grew. Eating horseflesh is supposed to bring on cramp, and
when a Sepoy at rifle practice misses the target, his comrades taunt
him with having eaten the unlucky meat.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">Modern Horse-worship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of modern horse-worship there are many examples. The
Palliw&acirc;l Br&acirc;hmans of Jaysalmer worship the bridle of a
horse, which Colonel Tod supposes to prove the Scythic origin of the
early colonists, who were equestrian as well as nomadic.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4442src" href="#xd21e4442" name=
"xd21e4442src">19</a> Horse-worship is still mixed up with the creed of
the Buddhists of Yun&acirc;n, who doubtless derived it from
India.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4445src" href="#xd21e4445" name=
"xd21e4445src">20</a></p>
<p>In Western India this form of worship is common. It is the chief
object of reverence at the Dasahra festival. Some R&acirc;jput
Bh&icirc;ls worship a deity called Ghor&acirc;deva or a stone horse;
the Bh&acirc;tiyas worship a clay horse at the Dasahra, and the Ojha
Kumh&acirc;rs erect a clay horse on the sixth day after birth, and make
the child worship it. Rag horses are offered at the tombs of saints at
Gujar&acirc;t. The Kunbis wash their horses on the day of the Dasahra,
decorate them with flowers, sacrifice a sheep to them, and sprinkle the
blood on them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4450src" href="#xd21e4450"
name="xd21e4450src">21</a> The custom among the Dr&acirc;vidian races
of offering clay horses to the local gods has been already noticed. The
Gonds have a horse godling in Kodapen, and at the opening of the rainy
season they worship a stone in his honour outside the village. A Gond
priest offers a pottery image of the animal and a heifer, saying,
&ldquo;Thou art our guardian! Protect our oxen and cows! Let us live in
safety!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4453src" href="#xd21e4453"
name="xd21e4453src">22</a> The heifer is then sacrificed and the meat
eaten by the worshippers. The Devak or marriage guardian of some of the
Dakkhin tribes is a horse.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Worship of the Ass.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The contempt for the ass seems to have arisen in
post-Vedic times. Indra had a swift-footed ass, and one of the epithets
of Vikramaditya was Gadharbha-r&ucirc;pa, or &ldquo;he in the form of
an ass.&rdquo; The Vishnu Pur&acirc;na tells of the demon Dhenuka, who
took the form of an ass and began to kick Balar&acirc;ma and Krishna,
as they were plucking fruit in the demon&rsquo;s grove. Balar&acirc;ma
seized him, with sundry of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209"
href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>companions and flung him on
the top of a palm tree. Khara, a cannibal R&acirc;kshasa who was killed
by R&acirc;ma Chandra, also used to take the form of an ass. Muhammad
said, &ldquo;The most ungrateful of all voices is surely the voice of
asses.&rdquo; Muhammadans believe that the last animal which entered
the ark was the ass to which Ibl&icirc;s was clinging. At the threshold
the beast seemed troubled and could enter no farther, when Noah said
unto him, &ldquo;Fie upon thee! Come in!&rdquo; But as the ass was
still in trouble and did not advance, Noah cried, &ldquo;Come in,
though the Devil be with thee!&rdquo; So the ass entered, and with him
Ibl&icirc;s. Thereupon Noah asked, &ldquo;O enemy of Allah! Who brought
thee into the ark?&rdquo; And Ibl&icirc;s answered, &ldquo;Thou art the
man, for thou saidest to the ass, &lsquo;Come in, though the Devil be
with thee!&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4463src" href=
"#xd21e4463" name="xd21e4463src">23</a></p>
<p>The worship of the ass is chiefly associated with that of
S&icirc;tal&acirc;, whose vehicle he is. The Agarw&acirc;la sub-caste
of Banyas have a curious rule of making the bridegroom just before
marriage mount an ass. This is done in secret, and though said to be
intended to propitiate the goddess of small-pox, is possibly a survival
of some primitive form of worship.</p>
<p>In folk-lore the ass constantly appears. We have in Somadeva the
fable of the ass in the panther&rsquo;s skin, which also appears in the
fifth book of the Panchatantra. Professor Weber asserts that it was
derived from the original in &AElig;sop, but this is improbable, as it
is also found in the Buddhist J&acirc;takas. In one of the
Kashm&icirc;r tales we have the bird saying, &ldquo;If any person will
peel off the bark of my tree, pound it, mix the powder with some of the
juice of its leaves and then work it into a ball, it will be found to
work like a charm; for any one who smells it will be turned into an
ass.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4470src" href="#xd21e4470" name=
"xd21e4470src">24</a> We have instances of ass transformation in
Apuleius and Lucian, and in German and other Western folk-tales.

<h3 class="main">The Lion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The lion, from his comparative rarity in Northern
India, appears little in popular belief. It is one of the vehicles of
P&acirc;rvat&icirc;, and rude images of the animal are sometimes placed
near shrines dedicated to Dev&icirc;. There is a current idea that only
one pair of lions exists in the world at the same time. They have two
cubs, a male and a female, which, when they arrive at maturity, devour
their parents. In the folk-tales the childless king is instructed that
he will find in the forest a boy riding on a lion, and this will be his
son. The lovely maiden in the legend of Jimutav&acirc;hana is met
riding on a lion. We have the lion Pingalika, king of beasts, with the
jackal as his minister, and in one of the cycle of tales in which the
weak animal overcomes the more powerful, the hare by his wisdom causes
the lion to drown himself. The basis of the famous tale of Androcles is
probably Buddhistic, but only a faint reference to it is found in
Somadeva. In one of the modern stories the soldier takes a thorn out of
the tiger&rsquo;s foot, and is rewarded with a box which contains a
manikin, who procures for him all he desires.<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Tiger.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The tiger naturally takes the place of the lion.
According to the comparative mythologists, &ldquo;the tiger, panther,
and leopard possess several of the mystical characteristics of the lion
as the hidden sun. Thus, Dionysos and Siva, the phallical god <i>par
excellence</i>, have these animals as their emblems.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4500src" href="#xd21e4500" name=
"xd21e4500src">26</a> Siva, it is true, is represented as sitting in
his ascetic form on a tiger skin, but it is his consort, Durg&acirc;,
who uses the animal as her vehicle. Quite apart from the solar myth
theory, the belief that witches are changed into tigers, and the terror
inspired by him, are quite sufficient to account for the honour
bestowed upon him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211"
name="pb211">211</a>]</span></p>
<p>Much also of the worship of the tiger is probably of totemistic
origin. Thus the Baghel R&acirc;jputs claim descent, and from him
(<i>b&acirc;gh, vy&acirc;ghra</i>, &ldquo;the spotted one&rdquo;)
derive their name. This tribe will not, in Central India, destroy the
animal. So, &ldquo;no consideration will induce a Sumatran to catch or
wound a tiger, except in self-defence, or immediately after the tiger
has destroyed a friend or a relation. When a European has set traps for
tigers, the people of the neighbourhood have been known to go by night
to the spot and explain to the tiger that the traps were not set by
them, nor with their consent.&rdquo; The Bh&icirc;ls and the
Bajr&acirc;wat R&acirc;jputs of R&acirc;jput&acirc;na also claim tiger
origin.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4512src" href="#xd21e4512" name=
"xd21e4512src">27</a></p>
<p>Another idea appearing in tiger-worship is that he eats human flesh,
and thus obtains possession of the souls of the victims whom he
devours. For this reason a man-eating tiger is supposed to walk along
with his head bent, because the ghosts of his victims sit on it and
weigh it down.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4517src" href="#xd21e4517"
name="xd21e4517src">28</a></p>
<p>He is, again, often the disguise of a sorcerer of evil temper, an
idea similar to that which was the basis of the European dread of
lycanthropy and the were-wolf. &ldquo;Accounts differ as to the way in
which the were-wolf was chosen. According to one account, a human
victim was sacrificed, one of his bowels was mixed with the bowels of
animal victims, the whole was consumed by the worshippers, and the man
who unwittingly ate the human bowel was changed into a wolf. According
to another account, lots were cast among the members of a particular
family, and he upon whom the lot fell was the were-wolf. Being led to
the brink of a tarn, he stripped himself, hung his clothes on an oak
tree, plunged into the tarn, and swimming across it, went into desert
places. There he was changed into a wolf, and herded with wolves for
nine years. If he tasted human blood before the nine years were out he
had to remain a wolf for ever. If during the nine years he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>abstained from preying on men, then, when the
tenth year came round, he recovered his human shape. Similarly, there
is a negro family at the mouth of the Congo who are supposed to possess
the power of turning themselves into leopards in the gloomy depths of
the forest. As leopards, they knock people down, but do no further
harm, for they think that if, as leopards, they once lapped blood, they
would be leopards for ever.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4524src"
href="#xd21e4524" name="xd21e4524src">29</a></p>
<p>Hence in India the jungle people who are in the way of meeting him
will not pronounce his name, but speak of him as G&icirc;dar,
&ldquo;the jackal,&rdquo; J&acirc;nwar, &ldquo;the beast,&rdquo; or use
some other euphemistic term. They do the same in many cases with the
wolf and bear, and though they sometimes hesitate to kill the animal
themselves, they will readily assist sportsmen to destroy him, and make
great rejoicings when he is killed. A Shik&acirc;ri will break off a
branch on the road as he goes along, and say, &ldquo;As thy life has
departed, so may the tiger die!&rdquo; When he is killed they will
bring forward some spirits and pour it on the head of the animal,
addressing him, &ldquo;Mah&acirc;r&acirc;ja! During your life you
confined yourself to cattle, and never injured your human subjects. Now
that you are dead, spare us and bless us!&rdquo; In Akola the gardeners
are unwilling to inform the sportsmen of the whereabouts of a tiger or
panther which may have taken up its quarters in their plantation, for
they have a superstition that a garden plot loses its fertility from
the moment one of these animals is killed there. So, with the Ainos of
Japan, who when a bear is trapped or wounded by an arrow, go through an
apologetic or propitiatory ceremony.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4529src" href="#xd21e4529" name="xd21e4529src">30</a></p>
<p>In Nep&acirc;l they have a regular festival in honour of the tiger
known as the B&acirc;gh J&acirc;tra, in which the worshippers used to
dance in the disguise of tigers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213"

<h3 class="main">Tiger-worship among the Jungle Races.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But, as is natural, the worship of the tiger prevails
more widely among the jungle races. We have already met with
B&acirc;gheswar, the tiger deity of the Mirzapur forest tribes. The
Sant&acirc;ls also worship him, and the Kis&acirc;ns honour him as
Banr&acirc;ja, or &ldquo;lord of the jungle.&rdquo; They will not kill
him, and believe that in return for their devotion he will spare them.
Another branch of the tribe does not worship him, but all swear by him.
The Bhuiy&acirc;rs, on the contrary, have no veneration for him, and
think it their interest to slay him whenever they have an opportunity.
The Ju&acirc;ngs take their oaths on earth from an ant-hill, and on a
tiger&rsquo;s skin; the ant-hill is a sacred object with the Khariyas,
and the tiger skin is brought in when the Hos and Sant&acirc;ls are
sworn. Among the eastern Sant&acirc;ls, the tiger is worshipped, but in
R&acirc;mgarh only those who have suffered from the animal&rsquo;s
ferocity condescend to adore him. If a man is carried off by a tiger,
the B&acirc;gh Bh&ucirc;t, or &ldquo;Tiger ghost,&rdquo; is worshipped,

W&acirc;gh&acirc;&icirc; Dev&icirc;, the tiger goddess, founded on a
spot where a Gond woman was once seized by a tiger. She is said to have
vanished as if by some supernatural agency, and the Gonds who desire
protection from wild beasts present to her altar gifts of every kind of
animal from a cow downwards. A Gond presides over the shrine and
receives the votive offerings.</p>
<p>In Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d the Bhomka is the priest of B&acirc;gh
Deo. &ldquo;On him devolves the dangerous duty of keeping tigers out of
the boundaries. When a tiger visits a village, the Bhomka repairs to
B&acirc;gh Deo, and makes his offerings to the god, and promises to
repeat them for so many years on condition <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>that
the tiger does not appear for that time. The tiger, on his part, never
fails to fulfil the compact thus solemnly made by his lord; for he is
pre-eminently an upright and honourable beast&mdash;&lsquo;pious
withal,&rsquo; as Mandeville says, not faithless or treacherous like
the leopard, whom no compact can bind. Some Bhomkas, however, masters
of more powerful spell, are not obliged to rely on the traditional
honour of the tiger, but compel his attendance before B&acirc;gh Deo;
and such a Bhomka has been seen, a very Daniel among tigers, muttering
his incantations over two or three at a time as they crouched before
him. Still more mysterious was the power of K&acirc;libh&icirc;t Bhomka
(now, alas! no more). He died, the victim of misplaced confidence in a
Louis Napoleon of tigers, the basest and most bloodthirsty of his race.
He had a fine large S&acirc;j tree into which, when he uttered his
spells, he would drive a nail. On this the tiger came and ratified the
contract with enormous paw manual. Such was that of Tim&ucirc;r the
Lame, when he dipped his mighty hand in blood and stamped its
impression on a parchment grant.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4556src" href="#xd21e4556" name="xd21e4556src">32</a></p>
<p>In the same way in other parts of the Central Provinces the village
sorcerers profess to be able to call tigers from the jungles, to seize
them by the ears, and control their voracity by whispering to them a
command not to come near their villages, or they pretend to know a
particular kind of root, by burying which they can prevent the beasts
of the forest from devouring men or cattle. With the same object they
lay on the pathway small models of bedsteads and other things which are
supposed to act as charms and stop their advance.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All sorts of magical powers are ascribed to the tiger
after death. The fangs, the claws, the whiskers are potent charms,
valuable for love philters and prophylactics against demoniacal
influence, the Evil Eye, disease and death. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>milk
of a tigress is valuable medicine, and it is one of the stock
impossible tasks or tests imposed upon the hero to find and fetch it,
as he is sent to get the feathers of the eagle, water from the well of
death, or the mystical cow guarded by D&acirc;nos or
R&acirc;kshasas.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4569src" href="#xd21e4569"
name="xd21e4569src">33</a> The fat is considered a valuable remedy for
rheumatism and similar maladies. The heart and flesh are tonics,
stimulants and aphrodisiacs, and give strength and courage to those who
use them. The Miris of Assam prize tiger&rsquo;s flesh as food for men;
it gives them strength and courage; but it is not suited for women, as
it would make them too strong-minded.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4572src" href="#xd21e4572" name="xd21e4572src">34</a> The
whiskers are believed, among other qualities which they possess, to be
a slow poison when taken with food, and the curious rudimentary
clavicles, known as Santokh or &ldquo;happiness,&rdquo; are highly
valued as amulets. There is a general belief that a tiger gets a new
lobe to his liver every year. A favourite amulet to repel demoniacal
influence consists of the whiskers of the tiger or leopard mixed with
nail parings, some sacred root or grass, and red lead, and hung on the
throat or upper arm. This treatment is particularly valuable in the
case of young children immediately after birth. Tiger&rsquo;s flesh is
also a potent medicine and charm, and it is burnt in the cow-stall when
cattle disease prevails. The flesh of the tiger, or if that be not
procurable, the flesh of the jackal is burnt in the fields to keep off
blight from the crops.</p>

In one of the Kashm&icirc;r tales, the hero in search of tiger&rsquo;s
milk shoots an arrow and pierces one of the teats of the tigress, to

gorging on a buffalo belonging to a poor oilman of Morwan. Whether the
tiger was an incarnation of one of the Mori lords of Morwan, tradition
does not say; but neither gun, bow, nor spear has ever been raised

disgusting form. At marriages among them, a terrible apparition appears
of two demoniacs possessed by B&acirc;gheswar, the tiger god. They fall
ravenously on a bleating kid, and gnaw it with their teeth till it
expires. &ldquo;The manner,&rdquo; says Captain Samuells, who witnessed
the performance, &ldquo;in which the two men seized the kid with their

<h3 class="main">Men Metamorphosed into Tigers.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The only visible difference between the ordinary
animal and a man metamorphosed into a tiger was explained to Colonel
Sleeman to consist in the fact that the latter had no tail. In the
jungles about Deori there is said to be a root, which if a man eats, he
is converted into a tiger on the spot; and if, when in this state, he
eats another species of root, he is turned back into a man again.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;A melancholy instance of this,&rdquo; said Colonel
Sleeman&rsquo;s informant, &ldquo;occurred in my own father&rsquo;s
family when I was an infant. His washerman Raghu was, like all
washermen, a great drunkard. Being seized with a violent desire to
ascertain what a man felt like in the state of a tiger, he went one day
to the jungle and brought back two of these roots, and desired his wife
to stand by with one of them, and the instant she saw him assume the
tiger&rsquo;s shape to thrust the root she held into his mouth. She
consented, and the washerman ate his root and instantly became a tiger,
whereupon she was so terrified that she ran off with the antidote in
her hand. Poor old Raghu took to the woods, and there ate a good many
of his friends from the neighbouring villages; but he was at last shot,
and recognized from his having no tail. You may be quite sure when you
hear of a tiger having no tail that it is some unfortunate man who has
eaten of that root, and of all the tigers he will be found the most
mischievous.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4616src" href=
"#xd21e4616" name="xd21e4616src">39</a></p>
<p>This is a curious reversal of the ordinary theory regarding the tail
of the tiger, to which a murderous strength is attributed. A Hindu
proverb says that the hair of a tiger&rsquo;s tail may be the means of
losing one&rsquo;s life. This has been compared by Professor De
Gubernatis with the tiger Mantikora spoken of by Ktesias, which has on
its tail hairs which are darts thrown by it for the purpose of
defence.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4621src" href="#xd21e4621" name=
"xd21e4621src">40</a></p>
<p>A Nep&acirc;l legend describes how some children made a clay image
of a tiger, and thinking the figure incomplete without a tongue, went
to fetch a leaf to supply the defect. On their return they found that
Bhairava had entered the image and had begun to devour their sheep. The
image of B&acirc;gh Bhairava and the deified children are still to be
seen at this place. We have the same legend in the Panchatantra and the
tales of Somadeva, where four Br&acirc;hmans resuscitate a tiger and
are devoured by it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4626src" href=
"#xd21e4626" name="xd21e4626src">41</a></p>
<p>We have many instances in the folk-tales of the tiger befooled.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>In one of the tales told by the M&acirc;njhis of
Mirzapur the goat has kids in the tiger&rsquo;s den, and when he
arrives she makes her kids squall and pretends that she wants some
tiger&rsquo;s flesh for them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4633src" href=
"#xd21e4633" name="xd21e4633src">42</a> In a Panj&acirc;bi tale the

flesh since the day before yesterday, when I killed three,&rdquo;
whereupon the tiger runs away. The tale which tells how the jackal
succeeds in getting the tiger back into the cage and thus saves the

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Nep&acirc;l legend which we have been
discussing we find Bhairava associated with the tiger, but his
prototype, the local godling Bhairon, has the dog as his sacred animal,
and his is the only temple in Benares into which the dog is
admitted.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4644src" href="#xd21e4644" name=

<p>Two conflicting lines of thought seem to meet in dog-worship. As Mr.
Campbell says, &ldquo;There is a good house-guarding dog, and an evil
scavenging and tomb-haunting dog. Some of the products of the dog are
so valued in driving off spirits that they seem to be a distinct
element in the feeling of respect shown to the dog. Still it seems
better to consider the dog as a man-eater, and to hold that, like the
tiger, this was the original reason why the dog was considered a
guardian.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4649src" href="#xd21e4649"
name="xd21e4649src">45</a> It is perhaps in this connection that the
dog is associated with Yama, the god of death.</p>

"BHAIRON AND HIS DOG." width="720" height="548">
<p class="figureHead">BHAIRON AND HIS DOG.</p>
</div>
<p>An ancient epithet of the dog is Kritajna, &ldquo;he that is mindful
of favours,&rdquo; which is also a title of Siva. The most touching
episode of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata is where <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e4659" title="Source: Yudishthira">Yudhisthira</span> refuses to
enter the heaven of Indra without his favourite dog, which is really
Yama in disguise. These dogs of Yama probably correspond to the Orthros
and Kerberos of the Greeks, and Kerberos has been connected
etymologically <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>with Sarvari, which is an epithet of the night,
meaning originally &ldquo;dark&rdquo; or &ldquo;pale.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4664src" href="#xd21e4664" name=
"xd21e4664src">46</a> The same idea shows itself in the P&acirc;rsi
respect for the dog, which may be traced to the belief of the early
Persians. The dog&rsquo;s muzzle is placed near the mouth of the dying
P&acirc;rsi in order that it may receive his parting breath and bear it
to the waiting angel, and the destruction of a corpse by dogs is looked
on with no feeling of abhorrence. The same idea is found in Buddhism,
where on the early coins &ldquo;the figure of a dog in connection with
a Buddhist St&ucirc;pa recalls to mind the use to which the animal was
put in the bleak highlands of Asia in the preferential form of
sepulchre over exposure to birds and wild beasts in the case of
deceased monks or persons of position in Tibet. Strange and horrible as
it may seem to us to be devoured by domestic dogs, trained and bred for
the purpose, it was the most honourable form of burial among
Tibetans.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4667src" href="#xd21e4667"
name="xd21e4667src">47</a></p>
<p>The Kois of Central India hold in great respect the P&acirc;ndava
brethren Arjuna and Bh&icirc;ma. The wild dogs or Dhol are regarded as
the D&ucirc;tas or messengers of the heroes, and the long black beetles
which appear in large numbers at the beginning of the hot weather are
called the P&acirc;ndavas&rsquo; goats. None of them will on any
account interfere with these divine dogs, even when they attack their
cattle.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4672src" href="#xd21e4672" name=

<h3 class="main">Dog-worship: Bhairon.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In modern times dog-worship appears specially in
connection with the cultus of Bhairon, the Br&acirc;hmanical Bhairava,
the Bhairoba of Western India. No Mar&acirc;tha will lift his hand
against a dog, and in Bombay many Hindus worship the dog of K&acirc;la
Bhairava, though the animal is considered unclean by them. Khand&ecirc;
R&acirc;o or Khandoba or Khandoji is regarded as an incarnation of Siva
and much <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>worshipped by Mar&acirc;thas. He is most
frequently represented as riding on horseback and attended by a dog and
accompanied by his wife Malsur&acirc;, another form of
P&acirc;rvat&icirc;. His name is usually derived from the Khanda or
sword which he carries, but Professor Oppert without much probability
would connect it with that of the aboriginal Kh&acirc;ndhs who are
supposed to have been original settlers in Kh&acirc;ndesh, after whom
it was called.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4682src" href="#xd21e4682"
name="xd21e4682src">49</a> In many temples of Bhaironn&acirc;th, as at
Benares and Hardw&acirc;r, he is depicted on the wall in a deep blue
colour approaching to black, and behind him is the figure of the dog on
which he rides. Sweetmeat sellers make little images of a dog in sugar,
which are presented to the deity as an offering.</p>
<p>At Loh&acirc;ru, in the Panj&acirc;b, a common-looking grave is much
respected by the Hindus. It is said to contain the remains of a dog
formerly possessed by the chief of the victorious Th&acirc;kurs, which
is credited with having done noble service in battle, springing up and
seizing the wounded warriors&rsquo; throats, many of whom it slew.
Finally it was killed and buried on the spot with beat of drum, and has
since been an object of worship and homage. &ldquo;Were it not,&rdquo;
says General Cunningham, &ldquo;for the Sagparast of Naishapur,
mentioned in Khusru&rsquo;s charming Darvesh tales, this example of
dog-worship would probably be unique.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

is hardly necessary to say, a mistake.</p>
<p>Thus, close to Bulandshahr, there is a grove with four tombs, which
are said to be the resting-place of three holy men and their favourite
dog, which died when the last of the saints departed this life. They
were buried together, and their tombs are held in much respect by
Muhammadans.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4692src" href="#xd21e4692"

<h3 class="main">Dogs in Folk-lore: The Bethgelert Legend.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The famous tale of Bethgelert, the faithful hound
which saves the child of his master from the wolf and is killed by
mistake, appears all through the folk-tales and was probably derived
from India. In the Indian version the dog usually belongs to a Banya or
to a Banj&acirc;ra, who mortgages him to a merchant. The merchant is
robbed and the dog discovers the stolen goods. In his gratitude the
merchant ties round the neck of the dog a scrap of paper, on which he
records that the debt has been satisfied. The dog returns to his
original master, who upbraids him for deserting his post, and, without
looking at the paper, kills him, only to be overcome by remorse when he
learns the honesty of the faithful beast. This famous tale is told at
Haidar&acirc;b&acirc;d, Lucknow, S&icirc;tapur, Mirzapur, and
Kashm&icirc;r. In its more usual form, as in the Panchatantra and the
collection of Somadeva, the mungoose takes the place of the dog and
kills the cobra on the baby&rsquo;s cradle.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4716src" href="#xd21e4716" name="xd21e4716src">55</a></p>
<p>Throughout folk-lore the dog is associated with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>spirits of the dead, as we have seen to be the
case with Sy&acirc;ma, &ldquo;the black one,&rdquo; and Sabala or
Karvara, the &ldquo;spotted ones,&rdquo; the attendants of
Yama.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4723src" href="#xd21e4723" name=
"xd21e4723src">56</a> Hence the dog is regarded as the guardian of the
household, which they protect from evil spirits. According to
Aubrey,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4726src" href="#xd21e4726" name=
"xd21e4726src">57</a> &ldquo;all over England a spayed bitch is
accounted wholesome in a house; that is to say they have a strong
belief that it keeps away evil spirits from haunting of a house.&rdquo;
As in the Odyssey, the two swift hounds of Telemachus bear him company
and recognize Athene when she is invisible to others, and the dogs of
Virgil howl when the goddess approaches, so the Muhammadans believe
that dogs recognize Azra&icirc;l, the angel of death, and in Northern
India it is supposed that dogs have the power of seeing spirits, and
when they see one they howl. In Shakespeare King Henry says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The owl shriek&rsquo;d at thy birth, an evil
sign;</p>
<p class="line">The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;</p>
<p class="line">Dogs howled and hideous tempests shook down
trees.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Hence in all countries the howling of dogs in the
vicinity of a house is an omen of approaching misfortune.</p>
<p>The respect for the dog is well shown in the case of the Bauris of
Bengal, who will on no account kill a dog or touch its body, and the
water of a tank in which a dog has been drowned cannot be used until an
entire rainy season has washed the impurity away. They allege that as
they kill cows and most other animals, they deem it right to fix on
some beast which should be as sacred to them as the cow to the
Br&acirc;hman, and they selected the dog because it was a useful animal
when alive and not very nice to eat when dead, &ldquo;a neat
reconciliation of the twinges of conscience and cravings of
appetite.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4740src" href="#xd21e4740"
name="xd21e4740src">58</a></p>
<p>Various omens are in the Panj&acirc;b drawn from dogs. When out
hunting, if they lie on their backs and roll, as they generally do when
they find a tuft of grass or soft ground, it shows that plenty of game
will be found. If a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223"
name="pb223">223</a>]</span>dog lies quietly on his back in the house,
it is a bad omen, for the superstition runs that the dog is addressing
heaven for support, and that some calamity is bound to happen.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4747src" href="#xd21e4747" name=
"xd21e4747src">59</a></p>
<p>We have seen already that some of the Central Indian tribes respect
the wild dog. The same is the case in the Hills, where they are known
as &ldquo;God&rsquo;s hounds,&rdquo; and no native sportsman will kill
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4752src" href="#xd21e4752" name=
"xd21e4752src">60</a> In one of Grimm&rsquo;s tales we read that the
&ldquo;Lord God had created all animals, and had chosen out the wolf to
be his dog,&rdquo; and the dogs of Odin were wolves.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4755src" href="#xd21e4755" name="xd21e4755src">61</a> Another
sacred dog in Indian folk-lore is that of the hunter Shambuka. His
master threw him into the sacred pool of Uradh in the Him&acirc;laya.
Coming out dripping, he shook some of the water on his owner, and such
was the virtue of even this partial ablution that on their death both
hunter and dog were summoned to the heaven of Siva.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4758src" href="#xd21e4758" name="xd21e4758src">62</a></p>
<p>All over Northern India the belief in the curative power of the
tongue of the dog widely prevails. In Ireland they say that a dried
tongue of a fox will draw out thorns, however deep they be, and an old
late Latin verse says:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter xd21e1941">

<p class="first">Among Musalm&acirc;ns the dog is impure. The vessel it

God!&rdquo; Then all game seized by him becomes lawful food.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Goat.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The goat is another animal to which mystic powers are
attributed. In the mythology of the West he is associated with
Dionysos, Pan, and the Satyr. In England it is commonly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>believed that he is never seen for twenty-four
hours together, and that once in this space he pays a visit to the
Devil to have his beard combed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4780src"
href="#xd21e4780" name="xd21e4780src">64</a> The Devil, they say,
sometimes appears in this form, which accounts for his horns and tail.
The wild goat was associated with the worship of Artemis, the Arab
unmarried goddess.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4783src" href=
"#xd21e4783" name="xd21e4783src">65</a> In the R&acirc;m&acirc;yana,
Agamukh&icirc;, or &ldquo;goat&rsquo;s face,&rdquo; is the witch who
wishes S&icirc;t&acirc; to be torn to pieces.</p>
<p>Mr. Conway asks whether this idea about the goat is due to the smell
of the animal, its butting and injury to plants, or was it demonized
merely because of its uncanny and shaggy appearance?<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4788src" href="#xd21e4788" name="xd21e4788src">66</a> Probably
the chief reason is because it has a curious habit of occasionally
shivering, which is regarded as caused by some indwelling spirit. The
Thags in their sacrifice used to select two goats, black, and perfect
in all their parts. They were bathed and made to face the west, and if
they shook themselves and threw the water off their hair, they were
regarded as a sacrifice acceptable to Dev&icirc;. Hence in India a goat
is led along a disputed boundary, and the place where it shivers is
regarded as the proper line. Plutarch says that the Greeks would not
sacrifice a goat if it did not shiver when water was thrown over
it.</p>
<p>In the Panj&acirc;b it is believed that when a goat kills a snake it
eats it and then ruminates, after which it spits out a Manka or bead,
which, when applied to a snake-bite, absorbs the poison and swells. If
it be then put in milk and squeezed, the poison drips out of it like
blood, and the patient is cured. If it is not put in milk, it will
burst to pieces.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4793src" href="#xd21e4793"
name="xd21e4793src">67</a> It hence resembles the Ovum Anguinum, or
Druid&rsquo;s Egg, to which reference has been already made.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4796src" href="#xd21e4796" name=
"xd21e4796src">68</a> If a person suffers from spleen, they take the
spleen of a he-goat, if the patient be a male; or of a she-goat, if the
patient be a female. It is rubbed on the region of the spleen seven
times on a Sunday or Tuesday, pierced with acacia thorns and hung on a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>tree. As the goat&rsquo;s spleen dries, the
spleen of the patient reduces.</p>
<p>The horn is regarded as somehow most closely connected with the
brain. So, in the &ldquo;Merry Wives of Windsor,&rdquo; Mrs. Quickly
says: &ldquo;If he had found the young man, he would have been horn
mad,&rdquo; and Horace gives the advice, &ldquo;<i lang="la">Fenum
habet in cornu longe fuge</i>.&rdquo; Martial describes how in his time
the Roman shrines were covered with horns, <i lang="la">Dissimulatque
deum cornibus ora frequens</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4809src"
href="#xd21e4809" name="xd21e4809src">69</a></p>
<p>It is for this reason that the local shrines in the Him&acirc;laya
are decorated with horns of the wild sheep, ibex, and goat. In Persia
many houses are adorned with rams&rsquo; heads fixed to the corners
near the roof, which are to protect the building from misfortune. In
Bilochist&acirc;n and Afghanist&acirc;n it is customary to place the
horns of the wild goat and sheep on the walls of forts and
mosques.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4814src" href="#xd21e4814" name=
"xd21e4814src">70</a> Akbar covered his Kos Minars or mile-stones with
the horns of the deer he had killed. The conical support of the
Banj&acirc;ra woman&rsquo;s head-dress was originally a horn, and many
classes of Faq&icirc;rs tie a piece of horn round their necks. We have
the well-known horn of plenty, and it is very common in the folk-tales
to find objects taken out of the ears or horns of the helpful
animals.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4817src" href="#xd21e4817" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We perhaps get a glimpse of totemism in connection
with the goat in some of the early Hindu legends. When Parusha, the
primeval man, was divided into his male and female parts, he produced
all the animals, and the goat was first formed out of his mouth. There
is, again, a mystical connection between Agni, the fire god,
Br&acirc;hmans, and goats, as between Indra, the Kshatriyas, and sheep,
Vaisyas and kine, S&ucirc;dras and the horse. These may possibly have
been tribal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=

venerated.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4827src" href="#xd21e4827" name=
"xd21e4827src">72</a> The sheep, as we have already seen, is a totem of
the Keriyas. The Aheriyas, a vagrant tribe of the North-Western
Provinces, worship Mekhasura or Meshasura in the form of a ram.</p>

<h3 class="main">Cow and Bull Worship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But the most famous of these animal totems or fetishes
is the cow or bull. According to the school of comparative mythology
the bull which bore away Europe from Kadmos is the same from which the
dawn flies in the Vedic hymn. He, according to this theory, is
&ldquo;the bull Indra, which, like the sun, traverses the heaven,
bearing the dawn from east to west. But the Cretan bull, like his
fellow in the Gnossian labyrinth, who devours the tribute children from
the city of the Dawn goddess, is a dark and malignant monster, akin to
the throttling snake who represents the powers of night and
darkness.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4835src" href="#xd21e4835"
name="xd21e4835src">73</a> This may be so, but the identification of
primitive religion, in all its varied phases, with the sun or other
physical phenomena is open to the obvious objection that it limits the
ideas of the early Aryans to the weather and their dairies, and
antedates the regard for the cow to a period when the animal was held
in much less reverence than it is at present.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Respect for the Cow Modern.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That the respect for the cow is of comparatively
modern date is best established on the authority of a writer, himself a
Hindu. &ldquo;Animal food was in use in the Epic period, and the cow
and bull were often laid under requisition. In the Aitareya
Br&acirc;hmana, we learn that an ox, or a cow which suffers
miscarriage, is killed when a king or honoured guest is received. In
the Br&acirc;hmana of the Black Yajur Veda the kind and character of
the cattle which should be slaughtered in minor sacrifices for the
gratification of particular divinities <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>are laid down in
detail. Thus a dwarf one is to be sacrificed to Vishnu, a
drooping-horned bull to Indra, a thick-legged cow to V&acirc;yu, a
barren cow to Vishnu and Varuna, a black cow to P&ucirc;shan, a cow
having two colours to Mitra and Varuna, a red cow to Indra, and so on.
In a larger and more important ceremonial, like the Aswamedha, no less
than one hundred and eighty domestic animals, including horses, bulls,
goats, sheep, deer, etc., were sacrificed.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4846width"><img src="images/p2226.jpg" alt=
"IMAGE OF THE SACRED BULL." width="720" height="415">
<p class="figureHead">IMAGE OF THE SACRED BULL.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The same Br&acirc;hmana lays down instructions for carving,
and the Gopatha Br&acirc;hmana tells us who received the portions. The
priests got the tongue, the neck, the shoulder, the rump, the legs,
etc., while the master of the house wisely appropriated to himself the
sirloin, and his wife had to be satisfied with the pelvis. Plentiful
libations of Soma beer were to be allowed to wash down the meat. In the
Satapatha Br&acirc;hmana we have a detailed account of the slaughter of
a barren cow and its cooking. In the same Br&acirc;hmana there is an
amusing discussion as to the propriety of eating the meat of an ox or
cow. The conclusion is not very definite. &lsquo;Let him (the priest)
not eat the flesh of the cow and the ox.&rsquo; Nevertheless
Yajnavalkya said (taking apparently a very practical view of the
matter), &lsquo;I, for one, eat it, provided it is
tender.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4852src" href=
"#xd21e4852" name="xd21e4852src">74</a></p>
<p>The evidence that cows were freely slaughtered in ancient times
could be largely extended. It is laid down in the early laws that the
meat of milch cows and oxen may be eaten, and a guest is called a
Goghna or &ldquo;cow-killer,&rdquo; because a cow was killed for his
entertainment.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4857src" href="#xd21e4857"
name="xd21e4857src">75</a> In the Grihya S&ucirc;tra we have a
description of the sacrifice of an ox to Kshetrapati, &ldquo;the lord
of the fields.&rdquo; In another ancient ritual the sacrifice of a cow
is stated to be very similar to that of the Sat&icirc;, and, according
to an early legend, kine were created from Parusha, the primal male,
and are to be eaten as they were formed from the receptacle of
food.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4860src" href="#xd21e4860" name=

<p>It need hardly be said that the worship of the cow is not peculiar
to India, but prevails widely in various parts of the world.<a class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Origin of Cow-worship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The explanation of the origin of cow-worship has been
a subject of much controversy. The modern Hindu, if he has formed any
distinct ideas at all on the subject, bases his respect for the cow on
her value for supplying milk, and for general agricultural purposes.
The Panchag&acirc;vya, or five products of the cow&mdash;milk, curds,
butter, urine, and dung&mdash;are efficacious as scarers of demons, are
used as remedies in disease, and play a very important part in domestic
ritual Gaurochana, a bright yellow pigment prepared from the urine or
bile of the cow, or, as is said by some, vomited by her or found in her
head, is used for making the sectarial mark, and as a sedative, tonic,
and anthelmintic. In Bombay it is specially used as a remedy for
measles, which is considered to be a spirit disease.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4875src" href="#xd21e4875" name="xd21e4875src">78</a></p>
<p>There is, again, something to be said for the theory which finds in
these animals tribal totems and fetishes.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4880src" href="#xd21e4880" name="xd21e4880src">79</a> We have a
parallel case among the Jews, where the bull was probably the ancient
symbol of the Hyksos, which the Israelites having succeeded them could
adopt, especially as it may have been retained in use by their
confederates the Midianites; and it appears in the earliest annals of
Israel as a token of the former supremacy of Joseph and his tribe, and
was subsequently adopted as an image of Iahveh himself.</p>
<p>So, speaking of Egypt, Mr. Frazer writes: &ldquo;Osiris was
regularly identified with the bull Apis of Memphis and the bull Mnevis
of Heliopolis. But it is hard to say whether <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>these bulls were embodiments of him as the corn
spirit, as the red oxen appear to have been, or whether they were not
entirely distinct deities which got fused with Osiris by syncretism.
The fact that these two bulls were worshipped by all the Egyptians,
seems to put them on a different footing from the ordinary sacred
animals, whose cults were purely local. Hence, if the latter were
evolved from totems, as they probably were, some other origin would
have to be found for the worship of Apis and Mnevis. If these bulls
were not originally embodiments of the corn god Osiris, they may
possibly be descendants of the sacred cattle worshipped by a pastoral
people. If this were so, ancient Egypt would exhibit a stratification
of the three great types of religion corresponding to the three great
stages of society. Totemism or (roughly speaking) the worship of wild
animals&mdash;the religion of society in the hunting stage&mdash;would
be represented by the worship of the local sacred animals; the worship
of cattle&mdash;the religion of society in the pastoral
stage&mdash;would be represented by the cults of Apis and Mnevis; and
the worship of cultivated plants, especially of corn&mdash;the religion
of society in the agricultural stage&mdash;would be represented by the
worship of Osiris and Isis. The Egyptian reverence for cows, which were
never killed, might belong either to the second or third of these
stages.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4887src" href="#xd21e4887"
name="xd21e4887src">80</a></p>
<p>There is some evidence that the same process of religious
development may have taken place in India. It is at least significant
that the earlier legends represent Indra as created from a cow; and we
know that Indra was the Kuladevat&acirc; or family godling of the race
of the Kusikas, as Krishna was probably the clan deity of some powerful
confederation of R&acirc;jput tribes. Cow-worship is thus closely
connected with Indra and with Krishna in his forms as the
&ldquo;herdman god,&rdquo; Govinda or Gop&acirc;la; and it is at least
plausible to conjecture that the worship of the cow may have been due
to the absorption of the animal as a tribal totem of the two races, who
venerated these two divinities.</p>
<p>Further, the phallic significance of the worship, in its
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>modern form at least, and its connection with
fertility cannot be altogether ignored.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4896src" href="#xd21e4896" name="xd21e4896src">81</a> This is
particularly shown in the close connection between Siva&rsquo;s bull
Nandi and the Lingam worship; and there seems reason to suspect that
the bull is intended to intercept the evil influences which in the
popular belief are continually emitted from the female principle
through the Yon&icirc;. As we have already seen, the dread of this form
of pollution is universal. Hence when the Lingam is set up in a new
village the people are careful in turning the spout of the Yon&icirc;
towards the jungle, and not in the direction of the roads and houses,
lest its evil influence should be communicated to them; and in order
still further to secure this object, the bull Nandi is placed sitting
as a guardian between the Yon&icirc; and the inhabited site.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4899src" href="#xd21e4899" name=
"xd21e4899src">82</a></p>
<p>Cow-worship assumes another form in connection with the theory of
transmigration. It has become part of the theory that the soul migrates
into the cow immediately preceding its assumption of the human form,
and she escorts the soul across the dreaded river Vaitaran&icirc;,
which bounds the lower world.</p>

<h3 class="main">Cow-worship: Its Later Development.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Though cow-worship was little known in the Vedic
period, by the time of the compilation of the Institutes of Manu it had
become part of the popular belief. He classes the slaughter of a cow or
bull among the deadly sins; &ldquo;the preserver of a cow or a
Br&acirc;hman atones for the crime of killing a priest;&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4909src" href="#xd21e4909" name=
"xd21e4909src">83</a> and we find constant references in the
medi&aelig;val folk-lore to the impiety of the Savaras and other
Dr&acirc;vidian races who killed and ate the sacred animal. Saktideva
one day, &ldquo;as he was standing on the roof of his palace, saw a
Chand&acirc;la coming along with a load of cow&rsquo;s flesh, and said
to his beloved Vindumat&icirc;: &lsquo;Look, slender one! How can the
evil-doer eat the flesh of cows, that are the object of veneration to
the three worlds?&rsquo; Then Vindumat&icirc;, hearing <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the horoscope forebodes some crime or special
calamity, the child is clothed in scarlet, a colour which repels evil
influences, and tied on the back of a new sieve, which, as we have
seen, is a powerful fetish. This is passed through the hindlegs of a
cow, forward through the forelegs towards the mouth, and again in the
reverse direction, signifying the new birth from the sacred animal. The
usual worship and aspersion take place, and the father smells his
child, as the cow smells her calf. This rite is known as the
Hiranyagarbha, and not long since the Mah&acirc;r&acirc;ja of
Travancore was passed in this way through a cow of gold.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4922src" href="#xd21e4922" name=
"xd21e4922src">85</a></p>
<p>The same idea is illustrated in the legend of the Pushkar Lake,
which probably represents a case of that fusion of races which
undoubtedly occurred in ancient times. The story runs that Brahma
proposed to do worship there, but was perplexed where he should perform
the sacrifice, as he had no temple on earth like the other gods. So he
collected all the other gods, but the sacrifice could not proceed as
Savitr&icirc; alone was absent; and she refused to come without
Lakshm&icirc;, P&acirc;rvat&icirc;, and Indr&acirc;n&icirc;. On hearing
of her refusal, Brahma was wroth, and said to Indra: &ldquo;Search me
out a girl that I may marry her and commence the sacrifice, for the jar
of ambrosia weighs heavy on my head.&rdquo; Accordingly Indra went and
found none but a G&ucirc;jar&rsquo;s daughter, whom he purified, and
passing her through the body of a cow, brought her to Brahma, telling
him what he had done. Vishnu said: &ldquo;Br&acirc;hmans and cows are
really identical; you have taken her from the womb of a cow, and this
may be considered a second birth.&rdquo; Siva said: &ldquo;As she has
passed through a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232"
name="pb232">232</a>]</span>cow, she shall be called
G&acirc;yatr&icirc;.&rdquo; The Br&acirc;hmans agreed that the
sacrifice might now proceed; and Brahma having married
G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, and having enjoined silence upon her, placed on
her head the jar of ambrosia and the sacrifice was performed.<a class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The respect paid to the cow appears everywhere in
folk-lore. We have the cow K&acirc;madhen&ucirc;, known also as
K&acirc;madugh&acirc; or K&acirc;maduh, the cow of plenty,
Saval&acirc;, &ldquo;the spotted one,&rdquo; and Surabh&icirc;,
&ldquo;the fragrant one,&rdquo; which grants all desires. Among many of
the lower castes the cow-shed becomes the family temple.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4937src" href="#xd21e4937" name=
"xd21e4937src">87</a> In the old ritual, the bride, on entering her
husband&rsquo;s house, was placed on a red bull&rsquo;s hide as a sign
that she was received into the tribe, and in the Soma sacrifice the
stones whence the liquor was produced were laid on the hide of a bull.
When a disputed boundary is under settlement, a cow skin is placed over
the head and shoulders of the arbitrator, who is thus imbued with the
divine influence, and gives a just decision. It is curious that until
quite recently there was a custom in the Hebrides of sewing up a man in
the hide of a bull, and leaving him for the night on a hill-top, that
he might become a spirit medium.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4940src"
href="#xd21e4940" name="xd21e4940src">88</a> The pious Hindu touches
the cow&rsquo;s tail at the moment of dissolution, and by her aid he is
carried across the dread river of death. I have more than once seen a
criminal ascend the scaffold with the utmost composure when he was
allowed to grasp a cow&rsquo;s tail before the hangman did his office.
The tail of the cow is also used in the marriage ritual, and the tail
of the wild cow, though nowadays only used by grooms, was once the
symbol of power, and waved over the ruler to protect him from evil
spirits. Quite recently I found that one of the chief Br&acirc;hman
priests at the sacred pool of Hardw&acirc;r keeps <span class=

wild cow&rsquo;s tail to wave over his clients, and scare demons from
them when they are bathing in the Brahma Kund or sacred pool.</p>
<p>The Hill legend tells how Siva once manifested himself in his fiery
form, and Vishnu and Brahma went in various directions to see how far
the light extended. On their return Vishnu declared that he had been
unable to find out how far the light prevailed; but Brahma said that he
had gone beyond its limits. Vishnu then called on
K&acirc;madhen&ucirc;, the celestial cow, to bear testimony, and she
corroborated Brahma with her tongue, but she shook her tail by way of
denying the statement. So Vishnu cursed her that her mouth should be
impure, but that her tail should be held holy for ever.<a class=

<p class="first">There are numerous instances of modern cow-worship.
The J&acirc;ts and G&ucirc;jars adore her under the title of
G&acirc;&ucirc; M&acirc;t&acirc;, &ldquo;Mother cow.&rdquo; The cattle
are decorated and supplied with special food on the Gopashtam&icirc; or
Gokulashtam&icirc; festival, which is held in connection with the
Krishna cultus. In Nep&acirc;l there is a New&acirc;ri festival, known
as the G&acirc;&ecirc; J&acirc;tra, or cow feast, when all persons who
have lost relations during the year ought to disguise themselves as
cows and dance round the palace of the king.<a class="noteref" id=

the Central Indian States, about the time of the Diw&acirc;l&icirc;,
the Maun Char&acirc;&ucirc;n, or silent tending of cattle, is
performed. The celebrants rise at daybreak, wash and bathe, anoint
their bodies with oil, and hang garlands of flowers round their necks.
All this time they remain silent and communicate their wants by signs.
When all is ready they go to the pasture in procession in perfect
silence. Each of them holds a peacock&rsquo;s feather over his shoulder
to scare demons. They remain in silence with the cattle for an hour or
two, and then return home. This is followed by <span class=

entertainment of wrestling among the Ah&icirc;rs or cowherds. When

<p>During an eclipse, the cow, if in calf, is rubbed on the horns and
belly with red ochre to repel the evil influence, and prevent the calf
being born blemished. Cattle are not worked on the Am&acirc;vas or Ides
of the month. There are many devices, such as burning tiger&rsquo;s

<p class="first">Of the unhappy agitation against cow-killing, which
has been in recent years such a serious problem to the British
Government in Northern India, nothing further can be said here. To the
orthodox Hindu, killing a cow, even accidentally, is a serious matter,
and involves the feeding of Br&acirc;hmans and the performance of
pilgrimages. In the Hills a special ritual is prescribed in the event
of a plough ox being killed by accident.<a class="noteref" id=

wandering tribe of Banj&acirc;ras. &ldquo;When sickness occurs, they
lead the sick man to the foot of the bullock called Hat&acirc;diya; for
though they say that they pay reverence to images, and that their
religion is that of the Sikhs, the object of their worship is this

chains and rings on neck and feet, and strings of cowry shells and
silken tassels hanging in all directions. He moves steadily at the head
of the convoy, and the place he lies down on when tired, that they make
their halting-place for the day. At his feet they make their vows when
difficulties overtake them, and in illness, whether of themselves or
cattle, they trust to his worship for a cure.&rdquo; The respect paid
by Banj&acirc;ras to cattle seems, however, to be diminishing. Once

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Infinite are the superstitions about cattle, their
marks, and every kind of peculiarity connected with them, and this has
been embodied in a great mass of rural rhymes and proverbs which are
always on the lips of the people. Thus, for instance, it is unlucky for
a cow to calve in the month of Bh&acirc;don. The remedy is to swim it
in a stream, sell it to a Muhammadan, or in the last resort give it
away to a Gujar&acirc;ti Br&acirc;hman. Here may be noticed the curious
prejudice against the use of a cow&rsquo;s milk, which prevails among
some tribes such as the Hos and some of the aboriginal tribes of
Bengal. The latter use a species of wild cattle, the Mithun, for
milking purposes, but will not touch the milk of the ordinary
cow.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5016src" href="#xd21e5016" name=

<h3 class="main">The Buffalo.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The respect paid to the cow does not fully extend to
the buffalo. The buffalo is the vehicle of Yama, the god of death. The
female buffalo is in Western India regarded as the incarnation of
Savitr&icirc;, wife of Brahma, the Creator. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>Durg&acirc; or Bhav&acirc;n&icirc; killed the
buffalo-shaped Asura Mahisa, Mahis&acirc;sura, after whom Mais&ucirc;r
is called. According to the legend as told in the M&acirc;rkandeya
Pur&acirc;na, Dit&icirc;, having lost all her sons, the Asuras, in the
fight with the gods, turned herself into a buffalo in order to
annihilate them. She underwent such terrible austerities to propitiate
Brahma, that the whole world was shaken and the saint Suparsva
disturbed at his devotions. He cursed Dit&icirc; that her son should be
in the shape of a buffalo, but Brahma so far mitigated the curse that
only his head was to be that of a buffalo. This was Mahis&acirc;sura,
who ill-treated the gods, until they appealed to Vishnu and Siva, who
jointly produced a lovely representation of a Bhav&acirc;n&icirc;, the
Mahis&acirc;surmardan&icirc;, who slew the monster. This
Mahis&acirc;sura is supposed to be the origin of the godling Mahasoba,
worshipped in Western India in the form of a rude stone covered with
red lead.</p>
<p>Another of these buffalo demons is Dundubhi, &ldquo;he that roars
like the sound of the kettle-drum,&rdquo; who in the
R&acirc;m&acirc;yana bursts with his horns the cavern of Bali, son of
Indra and king of monkeys. Bali seized him by the horns and dashed him
to pieces. The comparative mythologists regard him as one of the forms
of the cloud monster the sun.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5028src" href=

<p>Sadasiva, one of the forms of Mah&acirc;deva, took the form of a
buffalo to escape the P&acirc;ndavas, and sank into the ground at
Ked&acirc;rn&acirc;th. The upper portion of his body is said to have
come to the surface at Mukh&acirc;r Bind in Nep&acirc;l, where he is
worshipped as Pasupatin&acirc;tha. When the P&acirc;ndavas were freed
from their guilt, they in their gratitude built five temples in honour
of the hinder parts of the deity, which are now known as the
P&acirc;nch Ked&acirc;r-Kedarn&acirc;th, Madhya Maheswar,
Rudran&acirc;th, Tungun&acirc;th, and Kalpeswar.</p>
<p>The buffalo is constantly sacrificed at shrines in honour of
Durg&acirc; Dev&icirc;. The Toda worship of the buffalo is familiar to
all students of Indian ethnology. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238"

similar circumstances a gazelle with his mate. In the Vishnu
Pur&acirc;na, Bharata loses the fruits of his austerities by becoming
enamoured of a fawn. These fairy hinds appear throughout the whole

obstacles, who is propitiated at the commencement of any important
enterprise, such as marriage and the like. Many legends are told to
account for his elephant head. One tells how his mother
P&acirc;rvat&icirc; was so proud of her baby that she asked Sani to
look at him, forgetting the baneful effects of the look of the
ill-omened deity. When he looked at the child its head was burned to
ashes, and Brahma, to console her, told her to fix on the first head
she could find, which happened to be that of the elephant. By another
account she put Ganesa to guard the door while she was bathing, and
when he refused to allow Siva to enter, the angry god cut off his head,
which was afterwards replaced by that of the elephant. Again, one of
his tusks was broken off by Parasur&acirc;ma with the axe which Siva,
father of Ganesa, had given him.</p>

<p>Again, there are the Lokap&acirc;las, the eight supporters of the
world. These eight pairs of elephants support the earth. Indra with
Air&acirc;vata and Abhramu support the east; Agni with Pundar&icirc;ka
and Kapil&acirc; the south-east; Yama with V&acirc;mana and
Pingal&acirc; the south; S&ucirc;rya with Kumuda and Anupam&acirc; the
south-west; Varuna with Anjana and Anjanavat&icirc; the west;
V&acirc;yu with Pushpadanta and Subhadant&icirc; the north-west; Kuvera
on the north with Sarvabhauma, and Soma on the north-east with
Suprat&icirc;ka. As usual, there are differences in the
enumeration.</p>
<p>From these all the modern elephants are descended. As Abul Fazl
writes: &ldquo;When occasion arises people read incantations in their
names and address them in worship. They also think that every elephant
in the world is offspring of one of them. Thus, elephants of a white
skin and white hairs are related to the first, and elephants with a
large head and long ears, of a fierce and bold temper, and eyelids far
apart, belong to the second. Such as are good-looking, black, and high
in the back, are the offspring of the third. If tall, ungovernable,
quick in understanding, short-haired, and with red and black eyes, they
come from the fourth. If bright black, with one tusk longer than the
other, with a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>white breast and belly, and long and thick
forefeet, from the fifth. If fearful, with prominent veins, a short
hump and ears, and a long trunk, from the sixth. If thin-bellied,
red-eyed, and with a long trunk, from the seventh. And if of a
combination of the preceding seven qualities, from the
eighth.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5083src" href="#xd21e5083"
name="xd21e5083src">109</a></p>
<p>Through India the reverence for the white elephant of Burma and Siam
has arisen. The figure of the elephant appears on some of the pillars
of Asoka. There is an elephant gate at Fatehpur S&icirc;kri, one of the
King Huvishka at Mathura, and another connected with the dynasty of
Kanauj at Dabh&acirc;on in the Azamgarh District. Delhi contains the
remarkable elephant statues, believed by General Cunningham to have
been erected in honour of Jaymal and Patta, the two R&acirc;jput heroes
who defended the Fort of Chithor against Akbar.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The elephant constantly occurs in folk-lore. In the projection of
its forehead it possesses a pearl, known as the Kunjara Mani, or Gaja
Mukta, which is invested with magical qualities. In the folk-tales the
wooden horse of Troy is represented by an artificial elephant filled
with soldiers; other elephants have the power of flying through the
air; in other stories, as in one of La Fontaine&rsquo;s fables, an
elephant selects a king by raising him up with his trunk; the elephant
Kuvalyap&icirc;da is the guardian of a kingdom, and touching an
elephant is one of the tests of a woman&rsquo;s chastity. We have also

Among Muhammadans the cat is a pure animal, and to kill a cat is very
unlucky, and brings on trouble and sickness. So, among Hindus, the
killing of a cat can be expiated only by the performance of the rite
known as the Prajapati Yajna, which secures the birth of male issue.
They say that Mah&acirc;deva and P&acirc;rvat&icirc; were one day
playing dice, and P&acirc;rvat&icirc; called in Ganesa in his form as a
rat to upset the dice with his tail and cause her to make a good throw.
Mah&acirc;deva was wroth, and called in a demon like a cat, but he was
afraid to kill Ganesa. Then Mah&acirc;deva cursed any one in after days
who should kill a cat. We have the same tale in the Ras&acirc;lu cycle,
where the rat of Dhol R&acirc;ja changes the course of the game between
him and R&acirc;ja Sarkap. The cat is respected because she is the
vehicle of Shashth&icirc;, the protectress of children, and part of the
orthodox Hindu rite at dinner is giving food to the cat. Among the

R&acirc;ma in the R&acirc;m&acirc;yana orders S&icirc;t&acirc; to make
this offering, and Yama, in reward for its services, conceded to it the
right of eating the funeral meats, for which reason the souls of the

Bh&acirc;tus of Central India, a class of migratory athletes, worship
N&acirc;r&acirc;yana and the bamboo, with which all their feats are
performed. When they bury their dead they place rice and oil at the
head of the grave, and stand near to worship whatever animal comes to
eat the offerings. They draw the happiest omen of the state of the
departed from crows visiting the spot.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>In the Garuda Pur&acirc;na a tale is told of a wicked hunter who was
killed by a tiger in the depths of the forest, and his ghost became a
troublesome Bh&ucirc;t, until one day a crow carried off one of the
bones and dropped it into the Ganges, when the sinner was at once
carried in a heavenly chariot to the mansions of the blessed. This
legend is localized in the Hills and tells how Karma Sarma was killed
by a tiger in the forest. A crow took up one of his bones and carried
it to the shrine at Tungkshetra, and such is the virtue of the soil
there that the hunter was at once carried off to the heaven of
Indra.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5198src" href="#xd21e5198" name=

<p>Bhusundi is the legendary crow of the battlefield, who drinks the
blood of the slain. He had more blood than he could drink in the wars
of the two Asuras, Sumbha and Nisumbha, who contended with the gods. He
just quenched his thirst in the wars of R&acirc;ma, but broke his beak
against the hard, dry ground, which had soaked in the small amount of
blood shed by the comparatively degenerate heroes of the
Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata. He now croaks over the armies as they go out
to war, and looks for some Armageddon, when his thirst will at last be
satisfied.</p>
<p>Manifold are the ideas about crows and omens taken from their
appearance and cawing. Some people think a crow has only one eye, which
he shifts from one cavity to the other as he finds it convenient. In
the Panj&acirc;b, if a crow picks up a woman&rsquo;s handkerchief and
then drops it, she will not use it, but gives it to a beggar.<a class=

<p class="first">It is a common belief in Europe that the Hand of
Glory, or the dried-up hand of a criminal who has been executed, is a
powerful charm for thieves. In Ireland, &ldquo;if a candle is placed in
a dead hand, neither wind nor water can extinguish it, and if carried
into a house, the inmates will sleep the sleep of the dead as long as
it remains under the roof, and no power on earth can wake them as long

also used to stir the milk when butter will not form.<a class="noteref"

Northern India, thieves have a superstition that the ashes of a corpse

dusky storm-cloud,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5218src" href=

burglars, who carry about with them the stick out of a crow&rsquo;s
nest, the Gad k&icirc; Lakr&icirc;, which opens locks and holds the
household spell-bound. The Indian thief, like his English brother, by
the way, often carries about a piece of charcoal as a charm in his

<p class="first">The goose or swan is possibly an illustration of what
may be a tribal totem. It is said in the Bh&acirc;gavata Pur&acirc;na
that at one time there existed one Veda, one god Agni, and one caste.
This we learn from the commentator was in the Krita age, and the one
caste he tells us of was named Hansa or Swan. The Hansas are, again, in
the Vishnu Pur&acirc;na, said to be one of four castes or tribes
existing in a district exterior to India, and finally we learn from the
Linga Pur&acirc;na that Hansa was a name of Brahma himself. It is
reasonable to suppose that we have a swan tribe in the Indian
Hansas.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5269src" href="#xd21e5269" name=
"xd21e5269src">132</a> As an argument in favour of the theory that the
Hansa was a tribal totem, we find that the Kalhans R&acirc;jputs of
Oudh are said to take their name from the K&acirc;la Hansa or Black
Swan; that R&acirc;jputs nowadays will not eat it; and that the same
respect is shown to a bird of allied type, the Br&acirc;hmani Duck, and
its mate, the Chakwa, Chakwi of our rivers. They were once two lovers,
separated by fate, changed into ducks, and all through the night they
call sadly to each other across the broad stream of the Ganges, which
keeps them apart.</p>
<p>To the Hansa is ascribed the fabulous power of being able to
separate milk from water after the two have been mixed
together.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5274src" href="#xd21e5274" name=

<h3 class="main">Sundry Sacred Birds.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mention has already been made of Garuda, half man,
half bird, the vehicle of Vishnu. He is the son of one of the daughters
of Daksha, whom we have already met with in connection with the moon,
and the sage Kasyapa. According to the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata, he was
given leave to devour wicked men, but not to touch a Br&acirc;hman.
Once he did devour a Br&acirc;hman, but the holy man so burnt his
throat that he was glad to disgorge him. In the R&acirc;m&acirc;yana we
meet with Jat&acirc;yu, who is said to be a son of Garuda and king of
the vultures. He tried to stop the chariot in which R&acirc;vana was
abducting S&icirc;t&acirc;, and though wounded, was able to carry the
news to R&acirc;ma.</p>
<p>A bird known as the Malah&acirc;ri or &ldquo;filth destroyer&rdquo;
is a sort of totem of the Kanjar gipsies. If they see it singing on a
green branch to the front or right, it is an auspicious omen, and they
start at once on the prowl.</p>
<p>So with the Khanjar&icirc;t, in Sanskrit Khanjan&acirc;kriti, the
wagtail, which is also known as R&acirc;m Chiraiya or &ldquo;the bird
of R&acirc;ma.&rdquo; It is associated with Vishnu, because the marks
on its throat are said to resemble the S&acirc;lagr&acirc;ma. It comes
from the heaven of R&acirc;ma in the end of the rains, and remains till
the close of spring, and then bears back to R&acirc;ma a report of the
state of the world and the crops. When it first appears every one bows
to it. A Sanskrit text lays down that when a person first sees the
bird, if he be standing near a Br&acirc;hman, or near water, or sitting
on an elephant, or at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href=
"#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>daybreak, or when the bird is
flying near or sitting on a serpent, it is considered propitious. When
a person first sees it in the east, it brings him good luck all through
the year; when seen in the south-east, it predicts loss by fire; to the
south-west, fighting; to the west, acquisition of wealth; if seen to
the north-east, the observer will gain good clothes and jewels. He who
sees it in the north-west will die. The superstitions in Europe
connected with the magpie and cuckoo are of much the same class. In
Ireland it is said, &ldquo;Beware of killing the water wagtail, for it
has three drops of the Devil&rsquo;s blood in its little body, and
ill-luck ever goes with it and follows it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">The Hoopoe.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The legend of the hoopoe is thus told by Arrian:
&ldquo;To the king of the Indians was born a son. The child had elder
brothers, who, when they came to man&rsquo;s estate, turned out to be
very unjust and the greatest of reprobates. They despised their brother
because he was the youngest; and they scoffed at their father and their
mother, whom they despised because they were old and grey-headed. The
boy, accordingly, and his aged parents could no longer live with these
wicked men, and away they fled from home, all three together. In the
course of the protracted journeys which they had then to undergo, the
old people succumbed to fatigue and died, and the boy showed them no
light regard, but buried them in himself, having cut off his head with
a sword. Then, as the Brachmanes (Br&acirc;hman) tell us, the
all-seeing sun, in admiration of this surprising act of piety,
transformed the boy into a bird, which is most beautiful to behold, and
which lives to a very advanced age. So on his head there <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>grew
up a crest, which was, as it were, a memorial of what he had done in
the time of his flight.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5323src"
href="#xd21e5323" name="xd21e5323src">140</a></p>
<p>Somadeva gives another story of this bird. Rajatadanshtra one day
saw his sister Somaprabh&acirc; playing on a Pinjara, and when she
would not give it to him, took the form of a bird and flew away with it
to heaven. She cursed him that he should become a bird with a golden
crest, but promised that when in his bird shape he should fall into a
blind well, &ldquo;and a merciful person draws you out, and you do him
a service in return, you shall be released from this
curse.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5328src" href="#xd21e5328"

<p>The Muhammadan tradition is that the Hudhud, or hoopoe, had the
power of finding water which the devils have buried under the earth,
and she assisted Solomon to find water for ablution, and helped him to
find Bilq&icirc;s, the queen of Sheba. In Sweden the appearance of the
hoopoe is looked on as an omen of war.<a class="noteref" id=

I have often thought that the &lsquo;river calling&rsquo; of South
Africa, where there are no crocodiles, is the survival of an ancient
recollection of the time when the ancestors of the present Kaffirs

fish at sacred places with a l&acirc;kh or more of little balls of
flour wrapped up in Bhojpatra or birch bark or paper with the name of
R&acirc;ma written upon it. Their eating the name of the deity ensures
their salvation, and thus confers religious merit on the giver. The
fish is the vehicle of Khw&acirc;ja Khizr, the water god, and hence has
become a sort of totem of the Shiah Musalm&acirc;ns and the crest of
the late royal family of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href=

<h3 class="main">The Fish in Folk-lore.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The fish constantly appears in the folk-tales. We have
in Somadeva the fish that laughed when it was dead; the fish that
swallows the hero or heroine or a boat.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5433src" href="#xd21e5433" name="xd21e5433src">154</a> In one of
the Kashm&icirc;r tales we have the fish swallowing the ring, which is
like the tale which Herodotus tells of Polycrates. In another we have
the Oriental version of the story of Jonah, where the merchant is found
by the potter in the belly of the fish.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5436src" href="#xd21e5436" name="xd21e5436src">155</a> So,
Pradyumna, son of Krishna and Rukmin&icirc;, was thrown into the ocean
by the demon Sambara, and recovered from the belly of a fish by his
wife M&acirc;y&acirc; Dev&icirc;. In many of the modern tales the fish
takes the form of the Life Index. The king Bhartari, the brother of the
celebrated R&acirc;ja Vikramaditya, who is now a godling and spends
part of the day at Benares and part at the Chun&acirc;r Fort, had a
fish, &ldquo;the digestion of which gave him knowledge of all that
occurred in the three worlds.&rdquo; By a divine curse the nymph
Adrik&acirc; was transformed into a fish which lived in the
Jumn&acirc;. Here she conceived by the king Uparichara, was caught by a
fisherman, taken to the king and opened, when she regained her heavenly
form, and from her were produced Matsya, the male, and Matsy&acirc;,
the female fish, the progenitors of the finny race. The fish often
plays a part in the miraculous conception myths, as in the
Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata we read of a fish which devours the seed, and a
girl having eaten it brings forth a child. The fish incarnation of
Vishnu possibly represents the adoption of a fish totem into
Br&acirc;hmanism. It is needless to say that the legendary fish has
been identified with the sun by the school of comparative
mythologists.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5439src" href="#xd21e5439"

and of the Or&acirc;ons, neither of whom will eat it. In Northern
England an eel skin tied round the leg is a cure for cramp. Eel fat, in

<h3 class="main">The Tortoise.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The tortoise, again, is sacred. Vishnu appeared as a
tortoise in the Satya Yuga or first age to recover some things of value
which had been lost in the deluge. In the form of a tortoise he placed
himself at the bottom of the sea of milk, and made his back the basis
on which the gods and demons, using the serpent V&acirc;suki as a rope,
churned the ocean by means of the mount Mandara. The Ganr&acirc;r, a
tribe of Bengal fishermen, make sacrifices of the river tortoise to the
goddess Kolokum&acirc;r&icirc;, the daughter of the deep; this is the
only sacrifice she will accept, and she brings sickness on those who
fail to make this offering.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5458src" href=
"#xd21e5458" name="xd21e5458src">158</a> The tortoise is a totem of the
Mund&acirc;ri Kols, and the Kharw&acirc;rs and M&acirc;njhis of
Mirzapur worship clay images of it, which they keep in their house,
because on one occasion it conveyed their first ancestor across a river
in flood.</p>
<p>The Gonds have a similar tradition that the tortoise saved their
ancestor Lingo from the clutches of the alligator. The tortoise is also
a helper in one of the German tales.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5463src" href="#xd21e5463" name="xd21e5463src">159</a> In one of

<h3 class="main">The Frog.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The frog, again, is invested with mystical powers. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>monstrous toad of Berkeley Castle is said to be
really a seal.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5479src" href="#xd21e5479"
name="xd21e5479src">161</a></p>
<p>In English folk-lore it is associated with witches, and wears a
precious jewel in its head. Hindus believe that the female frog is the
spirit of Mandodar&icirc;, the wife of R&acirc;vana. It is a common
belief that the fat of the frog forms a magic ointment which enables
witches to fly through the air.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5484src"
href="#xd21e5484" name="xd21e5484src">162</a> According to a Scotch
Saga, the middle piece of a white snake roasted by the fire gives a
knowledge of supernatural things to anyone who shall put his finger in
the fat which drops from it. According to one of the Indian legends,
Agni, the fire god, took refuge in the water to escape the gods, but
the frogs, suffering from the heat, informed the gods, and the angry
deity cursed them that their speech should henceforth be inarticulate.
The frog by his voice announces the coming of rain; hence when rain
holds off it is a common charm to pour water over a frog, another
instance of sympathetic magic.</p>

<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Insects.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Even insects are in some cases regarded with
veneration. In Cornwall, the ants are &ldquo;the small people&rdquo; in
their state of decay from off the earth; it is deemed most unlucky to
destroy a colony of ants.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5501src" href=
"#xd21e5501" name="xd21e5501src">163</a></p>
<p>The ant-hill is, as we have seen, used as an altar by some of the
Dr&acirc;vidian tribes, and on it they take their oaths. Hence ants are
carefully fed on certain days by both Hindus and Jainas, and are
regarded as in some way connected with the souls of the sainted dead.
We have in many of the folk-tales the ant as a helper.</p>
<p>So, in many parts of the Panj&acirc;b, the many-coloured
grasshopper, which feeds on the leaves of the Mad&acirc;r or great
swallow wort, is called R&acirc;mj&icirc;-k&icirc;-g&acirc;&ecirc; or
&ldquo;R&acirc;ma&rsquo;s cow,&rdquo; which reminds us of the respect
paid by English <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257"
name="pb257">257</a>]</span>children to the ladybird insect.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5510src" href="#xd21e5510" name=
"xd21e5510src">164</a> So, the Greeks and Romans called the Cicada
Mantis or &ldquo;the soothsayer,&rdquo; and it is often delineated on
their tombs as a charm against evil. Mystic powers of the same kind are
attributed to the spider, and to Daddy Longlegs in our nurseries.</p>
<p>The souls of the dead are believed to enter into flies and bees.
Hence in parts of Great Britain news of a death in a family is
whispered into the beehive.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5515src" href=
"#xd21e5515" name="xd21e5515src">165</a> In one of Somadeva&rsquo;s
tales we find the monkeys trying to warm themselves over a firefly,
which is gifted with various miraculous powers.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5518src" href="#xd21e5518" name="xd21e5518src">166</a> A fly
falling into an inkstand is a lucky omen. In the R&acirc;m&acirc;yana
Hanum&acirc;n metamorphoses himself into a fly to reach
S&icirc;t&acirc;, and there are many instances of this in the
tales.</p>
<p>Lastly, comes the Tassar silkworm. In Mirzapur, when the seed of the
silkworm is brought to the house, the Kol or Bhuiy&acirc;r puts it in a
place which has been carefully plastered with cowdung to bring good
luck. From that time the owner must be careful to avoid ceremonial
impurity; he must give up cohabitation with his wife, he must not sleep
on a bed, he must not shave nor have his nails cut, nor anoint himself
with oil, nor eat food cooked with butter, nor tell lies, nor do
anything opposed to his simple code of morality. He vows to
Sing&acirc;rmat&icirc; Dev&icirc; that if the worms are duly born he
will make her an offering. When the cocoons open and the worms appear,
he collects the women of his house and they sing the usual song as at
the birth of a baby into the family, and some red lead is smeared on
the parting of the hair of all the married women of the neighbourhood.
He feeds his clansmen, and duly makes the promised offering to
Sing&acirc;rmat&icirc; Dev&icirc;. When the worms pair, the rejoicings
are made as at a marriage.</p>
<p>In Bengal, in addition to these precautions, the women, apparently
through fear of sexual pollution, are carefully excluded from the
silkworm shed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5525src" href="#xd21e5525"
name="xd21e5525src">167</a> We have the same idea <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>in
the Western Isles of Scotland, where they send a man very early on the
morning of the first of May to prevent any woman from crossing, for
that, they say, would prevent the salmon from coming into the river all
the year round.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5530src" href="#xd21e5530"

<p class="first">From the Baiga or Ojha, who by means of his grain
sieve fetish identifies the particular evil spirit by which his patient
is afflicted, we come to the regular witch or wizard. He works in India
by means and appliances which can be readily paralleled by the
procedure of his brethren in Western countries.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">The Witch.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The position of the witch has been so clearly stated
by Sir A. Lyall, that his remarks deserve quotation. &ldquo;The
peculiarity of the witch is that he does everything without the help of
the gods. It begins when a savage stumbles on a few natural effects out
of the common run of things, which he finds himself able to work by
unvarying rule of thumb. He becomes a fetish to himself. Fetishism is
the adoration of a visible object supposed to possess active power. A
witch is one who professes to work marvels, not through the aid or
counsel of the supernatural beings in whom he believes as much as the
rest, but by certain occult faculties which he conceives himself to
possess. There is a real distinction even in fetishism between the
witch and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>brother practitioner on a fetish, or between the
witch and the Shaman, who rolls about the ground and screams out his
oracles; and this line, between adoration and inspiration, vows and
oracles on the one side, and thaumaturgy by occult, incomprehensible
arts on the other, divides the two professions from bottom to top.
Hence, the witch, and not the man who works through the fetish, is
proscribed. Hence any disappointment in the aid which the aboriginal
tribes are entitled to expect from their gods to avoid averting disease
or famine, throws the people on the scent of
witchcraft.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5565src" href=
"#xd21e5565" name="xd21e5565src">2</a></p>
<p>Again, &ldquo;The most primitive witchcraft looks very like medicine
in the embryonic state; but as no one will give the aboriginal
physician any credit for cures or chemical effects produced by simple
human knowledge, he is soon forced back into occult and mystic devices,
which belong neither to religion nor to destiny, but are a ridiculous
mixture of both; whence the ordinary kind of witchcraft is
generated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he goes on to show how &ldquo;the great plagues, cholera and the
small-pox, belong to the gods; but a man cannot expect a great
incarnation of Vishnu to cure his cow, or find his lost purse; nor will
public opinion tolerate his going to any respectable shrine with a
petition that his neighbour&rsquo;s wife, his ox, or his ass may be
smitten with some sore disease.&rdquo; This, however, must be taken
with the correction that, as we have seen already, the deities which
rule disease are of a much lower grade than the divine cabinet which
rules the world. The main difference then between the hedge priest and
the witch is, as Sir A. Lyall shows, that the former serves his god or
devil, whereas the latter makes the familiar demon, if one is kept,
serve him.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Witchcraft: How Developed.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The belief in witchcraft is general among the lower
and less advanced Indian races. Colonel Dalton&rsquo;s assertion that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>the Ju&acirc;ngs, who were quite recently in the
stage of wearing leaf aprons, do not believe in witchcraft or sorcery,
must be accepted with great caution. It is quite certain that all the
allied Dr&acirc;vidian races, even those at a somewhat higher state of
culture than the Ju&acirc;ngs, such as Kols, Kharw&acirc;rs, and
Cheros, firmly believe in witchcraft. But all these people observe the
most extreme reticence on the subject. If you ask a Mirzapur Hill-man
if there are any witches in his neighbourhood, he will look round
furtively and suspiciously, and even if he admits that he has heard of
such people, he will be very reluctant to give much information about
them.</p>
<p>A belief in witchcraft is, then, primarily the heritage of the more
isolated and least advanced races, like the Kols and Bh&icirc;ls,
Sant&acirc;ls and Th&acirc;rus. In fact, whatever may be the ethnical
origin of the theory, it is at present in Northern India almost
specialized among the Dr&acirc;vidian, or aboriginal peoples. It also
widely prevails among those who lead a nomadic life and are thus
brought more directly in contact with nature in her wilder and sterner
moods, such as the Nat and the Kanjar, the H&acirc;b&ucirc;ra and the
S&acirc;nsiya. So, in Europe sorcery and fortune-telling, the charming
of disease, the making of love philters, and so on are the function of
the Romani; and Mr. Leland hazards the supposition that Herodias was a
gipsy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5581src" href="#xd21e5581" name=
"xd21e5581src">3</a></p>
<p>The belief that a certain person is a witch is probably generated in
various ways. Many a one becomes reputed as a witch from the
realization of some unlucky prophecy, or the fulfilment of some casual,
passionate curse or imprecation upon an enemy or rival. The old
Scottish rhymes exactly express this feeling:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">There dwelt a weaver in Moffat toun,</p>
<p class="line">That said the minister would die sune;</p>
<p class="line">The minister died, and the fouk o&rsquo; the toun</p>
<p class="line">They brant the weaver wi&rsquo; the wadd o&rsquo; the
lume,</p>
<p class="line">And ca&rsquo;d it weel-waned on the warloch
loon.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5597src" href="#xd21e5597" name=
"xd21e5597src">4</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span></p>
<p>With this is intimately connected the belief in the Evil Eye, and
that certain persons have the power of calling down on their enemies
the influence of evil spirits; and, as in Western lands, such a power
is often attributed to persons afflicted with ugliness, deformity,
crankiness of temper, liability to sudden fits of passion, epilepsy,
and the like. Disease or death, famine, accident, or any form of
trouble, never, in popular belief, come naturally. There is always
behind calamity some malignant power which selects the victim, and the
attribution of this faculty to any one naturally regarded as uncanny,
or who practises rites or worship strange to orthodox belief, is in the
opinion of the rustic only reasonable.</p>

<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Jigar Khor.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One particularly dreaded form of witch is the Jigar
Khor or liver-eater, of whom Abul Fazl gives a description: &ldquo;One
of this class can steal away the liver of another by looks and
incantations. Other accounts say that by looking at a person he
deprives him of his senses, and then steals from him something
resembling the seed of a pomegranate, which he hides in the calf of his
leg; after being swelled by the fire, he distributes it among his
fellows to be eaten, which ceremony concludes the life of the
fascinated person. A Jigar Khor is able to communicate his art to
another by teaching him incantations, and by making him eat a bit of
the liver cake. These Jigar Khors are mostly women. It is said they can
bring intelligence from a long distance in a short space of time, and
if they are thrown into a river with a stone tied to them, they
nevertheless will not sink. In order to deprive any one of this wicked
power, they brand his temples and every joint of his body, cram his
eyes with salt, suspend him for forty days in a subterraneous chamber,
and repeat over him certain incantations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the modern Jigar Khors of the Panj&acirc;b we are told that when
a witch succeeds in taking out a man&rsquo;s liver, she will not eat it
for two and a half days. If after eating it she is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>put
under the influence of an exorciser, she can be forced to take the
liver of some animal and put it back to replace that taken from the
original victim.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5612src" href="#xd21e5612"
name="xd21e5612src">5</a> In one of the tales of Somadeva the wicked

<h3 class="main">The Witch in Folk-lore.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have already learned to look to the folk-tales for
the most trustworthy indications of popular belief, and here the dark
shadow of witchcraft overclouds much of their delicate fancy. Here we
find the witch taking many forms&mdash;of an old woman in trouble, of a
white hind with golden horns, of a queen. Others, like the archwitch
K&acirc;lar&acirc;tr&icirc; or &ldquo;black night,&rdquo; are of
repulsive appearance; she has dull eyes, a depressed, flat nose. Her
eyebrows, like those of the werewolves or vampires of
Slavonia,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5623src" href="#xd21e5623" name=
"xd21e5623src">7</a> meet together; she has large cheeks, widely parted
lips, projecting teeth, a long neck, pendulous breasts, a large belly,
and broad, expanded feet. &ldquo;She appears as if the Creator had made
a specimen of his skill in producing ugliness.&rdquo; Like the Jigar
Khor she obtains her powers by eating human flesh, or like modern
witches, who claim to possess the D&acirc;yan k&acirc; Mantra or
D&acirc;kin&icirc;&rsquo;s spell, by which she can tear out the heart
of her victim.</p>
<p>The powers of such witches are innumerable. They can find anything
on earth, can open or patch up the sky, possess second sight, can
restore the dead to life, can set fire to water, can turn stones into
wax, can separate lovers, can metamorphose the hero into any shape they
please. They control the weather and cause storms and tempests. If they
follow one they hate and measure his footsteps in the dust, he at once
becomes lame.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5631src" href="#xd21e5631"
name="xd21e5631src">8</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href=
"#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span></p>
<p>They carry on their unholy revels in cemeteries and cremation
grounds. They meet under the leadership of the dreaded Bhairava, as
German witches assemble on the Blocksberg. So Diana Herodias leads the
Italian witches who meet at the walnut tree of Benevento, as those of
Cornwall collect at Trewa.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5640src" href=
"#xd21e5640" name="xd21e5640src">9</a></p>
<p>Many witches obtain power over the fever demon. She fastens a string
round the hero&rsquo;s neck, and by a spell turns him into an ape. She
often kills a child, and the heroine, like Genoveva, is falsely
accused, and expelled from her home, until the plot is discovered and
she is restored to her husband&rsquo;s love. Lastly, we have the
conflict between the powers of good and evil, the benevolent and
malignant witch, which forms one of the stock incidents of the European
folk-tales.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5648src" href="#xd21e5648" name=
"xd21e5648src">10</a> The malignant, liver-eating witch is naturally
associated with the tomb-haunting badger. One of them appeared quite
recently at Ahmad&acirc;b&acirc;d, and being supposed to carry off
children in the disguise of a badger, was called Adam Khor, or the
devourer of the sons of men.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5654src" href=

spell, an elder dame has usually in hand some younger girl, whom she
instructs, firstly, in the art of bewitching or injuring enemies, and
secondly, in the more important processes of annulling or unbinding the
spells of others, or causing mutual love or conferring luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, among the Agariyas of Bengal, there are old women, professors of
witchcraft, who stealthily instruct the young girls. &ldquo;The latter
are all eager to be taught, and are not considered proficient till a
fine forest tree selected to be experimented on is destroyed by the
potency of their charms; so that the wife a man takes to his bosom has
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=

in the belief that she can, if she pleases, dispose of her husband in
the same manner, if he makes himself obnoxious.&rdquo;<a class=

<p>So, in Bombay, when a Guru, or teacher, wishes to initiate a
candidate into the mysteries of the Black Art, he directs the candidate
to watch a favourable opportunity for the commencement of the study,
the opportunity being the death of a woman in childbirth. As soon as
this event takes place, the candidate is instructed what to do. He
watches the procession as the dead is being taken to the burning or
burial ground, and takes care to see who the bearers are. He then takes
a small tin box in his hand, and picking up a pinch of the earth out of
the hind footsteps of the two rear bearers, he keeps the earth in the
tin box. Then he watches where the dead body is being burnt, and goes
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next day he goes to the spot, and taking a little of the
ashes of the corpse, puts it in the tin box. Subsequently, on a
suitable day, that is on a new moon or on an eclipse day, he goes to
the burning ground at midnight, and taking off his clothes, he sits on
the ground, and placing the tin box in front of him, lights a little
incense, and repeats the incantations taught to him by his guru or
teacher. When he has practised the repetition of the incantations, the
spirit Hadal becomes subject to his control, and by her help he becomes
able to annoy any one he pleases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the troubles which the witch or magician brings upon
his enemies, the following are said to be the most common in the
Dakkhin as well as in the Konkan. The witch causes star-shaped or
cross-like marks of marking-nuts on the body of the person she has a
grudge against. The peculiarity of these marks is that they appear in
numbers in different parts of the body, and as suddenly disappear. The
other troubles are the drying-up of the milk of milch cattle, or
turning the milk into blood; stopping or retarding the growth of the
foetus in cattle, and turning them into moles; stealing grain or other
field <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>produce from the farm-yards of the victim;
letting loose wolves, jackals, or rats into the victim&rsquo;s field;
pricking needles or thorns into the victim&rsquo;s eyes or body;
applying turmeric to the eyes of a female victim, or putting lampblack
into her eyes; or tearing the open end of her robe; and causing death
to an enemy by means of a method of the Black Art, called M&ucirc;th,
literally &lsquo;a handful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The M&ucirc;th generally consists of a handful of rice or
Urad pulse (<i>Phaseolus radiatus</i>) charmed and sent by the witch
against her enemy through the agency of the familiar spirit. It is
likened to a shock of electricity sudden and sharp, which strikes in
the centre of the heart, causes vomiting and spitting of blood, and
may, if not warded against, end in the death of the victim. Practised
experts pretend to see the M&ucirc;th rolling through the air, like a
red-hot ball, and say that they can avert its evil consequences in two
ways&mdash;either by satiating it, which is done so as to cause a
little bleeding, and allowing the blood to drop on a charmed lemon,
which is afterwards cut and thrown into a river; or by reversing its
action and sending it back to the person who issued it, which is done
by charging a lemon and throwing it in the direction whence the
M&ucirc;th has been seen to come. The operation of a M&ucirc;th is most
dreaded in many parts of Bombay, and especially in the Konkan. Cases of
sudden illness, blood vomiting, or sudden death are frequently
attributed to the agency of a M&ucirc;th or charmed handful of rice or
pulse sent by an enemy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5690src"

<h3 class="main">Witch Seasons.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Central India, witches are supposed, by the aid of
their familiars, who are known as B&icirc;r, or &ldquo;the hero,&rdquo;
to inflict pain, disease, and death upon human beings. Their power of
witchcraft, like that of all Indian witches, exists on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>fourteenth, fifteenth, and twenty-ninth of each
month, and in particular at the Diw&acirc;l&icirc; or feast of lamps,
and the Naur&acirc;tr&icirc; or nine days devoted to the worship of
Durg&acirc;.</p>
<p>In the same way the Irish witches flit on November Eve, and
&ldquo;on that night mortal people should keep at home, or they will
suffer for it; for souls of the dead have power over all things on that
night of the year, and they hold a festival with the fairies, and drink
red wine from the fairy cups and dance to fairy music till the moon
goes down.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5704src" href="#xd21e5704"
name="xd21e5704src">15</a> Of the Allhallows demon Professor Rhys
writes: &ldquo;This night was the Saturnalia of all that was hideous
and uncanny in the world of spirits. It had been fixed as the time of
all others when the Sun god, whose power had been gradually falling off
since the great feast associated with him on the first of August,
succumbed to his enemies, the powers of darkness and of winter. It was
their first hour of triumph after an interval of subjection, and the
popular imagination pictured them stalking abroad with more than
ordinary insolence and aggressiveness.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5707src" href="#xd21e5707" name="xd21e5707src">16</a></p>
<p>At other times the Indian witches appear, dress, talk, and eat like
other women, but &ldquo;when the fit is on them, they are sometimes
seen with their eyes glaring red, their hair dishevelled and bristled,
while their heads are often turned round in a strange, convulsive
manner. On the nights of those days, they are believed to go abroad,
and after casting off their garments, to ride about on tigers and other
wild animals; and if they desire to go on the water, alligators come
like the beasts of the forests at their call, and they disport in
rivers and lakes upon their backs till dawn of day, about which period
they always return home, and resume their usual forms and
occupations.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5712src" href=

<h3 class="main">Witches Taking the Form of Tigers.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The idea that witches take the form of tigers is
widespread. Colonel Dalton describes how a Kol, tried for the murder of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>a wizard, stated in his defence that his wife
having been killed by a tiger in his presence, he stealthily followed
the animal as it glided away after gratifying its appetite, and saw
that it entered the house of one P&ucirc;sa, a Kol, whom he knew. He
called out P&ucirc;sa&rsquo;s relations, and when they heard the story,
they not only credited it, but declared that they had long suspected
P&ucirc;sa of possessing such power; on entering they found him, and
not a tiger; they delivered him bound into the hands of his accuser,
who at once killed him. In explanation of their proceedings, they
deposed that P&ucirc;sa had one night devoured an entire goat, and
roared like a tiger while he was eating it; and on another occasion he
had informed his friends that he felt a longing for a particular
bullock, and that very night the bullock was carried off by a
tiger.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5722src" href="#xd21e5722" name=
"xd21e5722src">18</a></p>
<p>Mr. Campbell gives a very similar story from Bombay, in which a
man-eating tiger was supposed to be a witch in disguise.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5727src" href="#xd21e5727" name=
"xd21e5727src">19</a> All these stories very closely resemble the
European were-wolf and similar legends.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5730src" href="#xd21e5730" name="xd21e5730src">20</a> In Mirzapur
they tell a tale of one of the Dr&acirc;vidian Bhuiy&acirc;rs, whose
wife went recently on the Pura Mamu&acirc;r Hill, when an evil spirit
in the form of a tiger attacked and killed her. This was after her
death ascertained to be the case by the inquiries of the village Baiga,
who now does an annual ceremony and sacrifice near the place. For such
witch tigers the favourite remedy is to knock out their teeth to
prevent their doing any more mischief and becoming the Indian
equivalent of the Loupgarou.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5733src" href=

<h3 class="main">Witches Extracting Substances from their Victims.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another remedy is thus described by Abul Fazl:
&ldquo;The sorceress casts something out of her mouth like the grain of
a pomegranate, which is believed to be part of the heart which she has
eaten. The patient picks it up as part of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>own
intestine and greedily swallows it. By this means, as if his heart was
replaced in his body, he recovers his health by degrees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea that witches extract substances out of a sick
person&rsquo;s body is very common.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5746src"
href="#xd21e5746" name="xd21e5746src">22</a> The witch in Macbeth says,
&ldquo;I will drain him dry as hay.&rdquo; In the same way the original
object of kissing is said to be to extract an evil spirit out of a
person. Many people get a holy man to kiss a sick child and blow over
some water which is given it to drink, and thus the evil spirit is
removed.</p>
<p>General Sleeman gives the case of a trooper who had taken some milk
from an old woman without payment, and was seized with severe internal
pains, which he attributed to her witchcraft. She was sent for, but
denied having bewitched him. She admitted, however, that &ldquo;the
household gods may have punished him for his wickedness.&rdquo; She was
ordered to cure him, and set about collecting materials for the
purpose, but meanwhile the pains left him.</p>
<p>Another man took a cock from an old Gond woman and was similarly
affected. &ldquo;The old cock was actually heard crowing in his
belly.&rdquo; In spite of all the usual remedies he died, and the cock
never ceased crowing at intervals till his death.</p>
<p>He tells of another witch who was known to be such by the juice of
the sugar-cane she was eating turning into blood. A man saw her staring
at him and left the district at once. &ldquo;It is well known that
these spells and curses can only reach a distance of ten or twelve
miles, and if you offend one of these witches, the sooner you put that
distance between you and them, the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another witch was bargaining with a man for some sugar-cane. She
seized one end of the stalk and the purchaser the other. A scuffle
ensued, and a soldier came up and cut the cane in two with a sword.
Immediately a quantity of blood flowed from the cane to the ground,
which the witch had been drawing through it from the man&rsquo;s body.
So we read of the two witches in the Italian tale, who &ldquo;seeing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>that he would not go, cast him by their
witchcraft into a deep sleep, and with a small tube sucked all his
blood from his veins, and made it into a blood pudding which they
carried with them. And this gave them the power to be invisible till
they should return.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5759src" href=
"#xd21e5759" name="xd21e5759src">23</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the general belief that there is not a village or a
single family without its witch in this part of the country. Indeed, no
one will give his daughter in marriage to a family without one, saying,
&lsquo;If my daughter has children, what will become of them without a
witch to protect them from witches of other families in the
neighbourhood?&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5764src" href=
"#xd21e5764" name="xd21e5764src">24</a> Sir John Malcolm notices the
same fact. &ldquo;In some places men will not marry into a family where
there is not a D&acirc;kin&icirc; or witch to save them from the malice
of others; but this name, which is odious, is not given to those
persons by their relations and friends. They are termed
Rakhw&acirc;l&icirc; or guardians.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">Witches and Cats.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One sign of the witch is that she is accompanied by
her cat. This is an idea which prevails all over the world. Thus, in
Ireland, cats are believed to be connected with demons. On entering a
house the usual salutation is, &ldquo;God save all here except the
cat!&rdquo; Even the cake on the griddle may be blessed, but no one
says, &ldquo;God bless the cat!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

all soundly.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5780src" href=
"#xd21e5780" name="xd21e5780src">27</a> One explanation of the
connection of witches and cats is that &ldquo;when Galinthis was
changed into a cat by the Fates, Hecate took pity on her and made her
her priestess, in which office she continues to this
day.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5786src" href="#xd21e5786" name=
"xd21e5786src">28</a> We have already seen that it is probably her
stealthy ways and habit of going about at night which gave the cat her
uncanny character. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271"
name="pb271">271</a>]</span></p>
<p>The cat, say the jungle people, is aunt of the tiger, and taught him
everything but how to climb a tree. The Or&acirc;ons of Chota
N&acirc;gpur say that Chordeva, the birth fiend, comes in the form of a
cat and worries the mother.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5792src" href=
"#xd21e5792" name="xd21e5792src">29</a> The Thags used to call the
caterwauling of cats <i>K&acirc;l&icirc; ki Mauj</i>, or the roaring
wave of K&acirc;l&icirc;, and it was of evil omen. The omen could be
obviated only by gargling the mouth in the morning with sour milk and
spitting it out. We have already seen the danger of killing a cat.
Z&acirc;lim Sinh, the famous regent of Kota, thought that cats were
associated with witches, and on one occasion when he believed himself
exposed to enchantment, ordered that every cat should be expelled from
his cantonment.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5798src" href="#xd21e5798"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All the ordeals for witches turn on the efficacy of
certain things to which reference has been already made as scarers of
evil spirits.</p>
<p>Thus, the ordeal of walking over hot coals and on heated
ploughshares was a common method of testing a witch both in India and
in Europe.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5808src" href="#xd21e5808" name=
"xd21e5808src">31</a> Z&acirc;lim Sinh, however, generally used the
water ordeal, a test which is known all over the world.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5817src" href="#xd21e5817" name=
"xd21e5817src">32</a> Even Pliny knew that Indian witches could not
sink in water.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5820src" href="#xd21e5820"
name="xd21e5820src">33</a> Manu prescribes water as a form of oath, and
to this day it is a common form of oath ordeal for a man to stand in
water when he is challenged to swear. Z&acirc;lim Sinh used to say that
handling balls of hot iron was too slight a punishment for such sinners
as witches, for it was well known that they possessed substances which
enabled them to do this with impunity; so he used to throw them into a
pool of water; if they sank, they were innocent; if they, unhappily,
came to the surface, their league with the powers of darkness was
apparent. A bag of cayenne pepper <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272"
href="#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>tied over the head, if it
failed to suffocate, afforded another test.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most humane method employed was rubbing the eyes with a
well-dried capsicum; and certainly if they could furnish the
demonstration of their innocence by withholding tears, they might
justly be deemed witches.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5827src"

village, whether married or unmarried, who had attained the age of
twelve years, were planted in the morning in water for the space of
four and a half hours; and the withering of any of these branches was
proof of witchcraft against the person whose name was attached to it.
Small portions of rice enveloped in pieces of cloth marked as before,
were placed in a nest of white ants; the consumption of the rice in any
of the bags was proof of witchcraft against the woman whose name it
bore. Lamps were lighted at night; water was placed in cups made of
leaves, and mustard oil was poured drop by drop into the water, while
the name of each woman in the village was pronounced. The appearance of
the shadow of any woman in the water during the ceremony proved her to
be a witch.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5844src" href="#xd21e5844" name=

the community, and when these had been <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

experience soon enabled him to seize on some ugly or unlucky
idiosyncrasy, which indicated in unmistakable clearness the unhappy
offender. If no conclusion could be arrived at in this way, he lighted
an ordinary earthen lamp, and repeating consecutively the name of each
woman in the village, he fixed on the witch or witches by the flicker
of the wick when the name or names were mentioned. The discovery of the
witch soon led to her being grossly maltreated, and, under the Native
Government, almost invariably in her death. Since the introduction of
the British rule these cases are becoming year <span class="corr" id=

an interesting chapter in folk-lore. Thus, we have the famous legend
which tells how a golden egg was produced at the beginning of all
things, and from it Prajapati Brahma, the great progenitor of the

the folk-tales in the numerous stories of children produced from

ostrich hung up in mosques and tombs to repel evil influences. We have
the same idea in the use of eggs at Easter in England. In the Konkan,
Kunbis give a mixture of eggs and turmeric to a man who spits blood;
and to remove the effects of the Evil Eye, they wave bread and an egg
round a sick person. The Sult&acirc;nk&acirc;rs, when their wives are
possessed with evil spirits, offer rice, a fowl, and an egg, and the
spirit passes away. The Beni Israels, to avert evil, break a

substitute for these magic trees is a branch of the tamarind, or a
stalk of the castor-oil tree (<i>Palma Christi</i>). If, after
receiving in silence an ordinary scourging by the usual methods, the
suspected person cries out at a blow with the magic branch, he is
certainly guilty.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5909src" href="#xd21e5909"

exceedingly afraid of even a slight blow with a castor-oil switch.</p>

their craft by eating filth. We have already seen that this is also

belief, is always very lovely and scrupulously neat <span class=

her personal appearance, and she always has a clear line of red lead
applied to the parting of her hair. Witches have a special power of
casting evil glances on children, and after a child is buried, they are
believed to exhume the corpse, anoint it with oil, and bring it to life
to serve some occult purpose of their own. On the same principle the
K&acirc;firs believe that dead bodies are restored to life, and made
hobgoblins to aid their owners in mischief.<a class="noteref" id=

witches, moreover, are supposed to keep a light burning during the

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One well-known characteristic of witches is that she
cannot die as long as she is a witch, but must while alive pass on her
craft to another, is well recognized in India. Hence a witch is always
on the look-out for some one to whom she may delegate her functions,
and many well-meaning people have been ruined in this way through
misplaced confidence in the benevolence of a witch.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5938src" href="#xd21e5938" name="xd21e5938src">50</a></p>
<p>Indian witches also resemble their European sisters in their habit

known only to themselves, and to say them backwards. We have the same
belief in one of the tales of Somadeva, where Bh&icirc;mabhatta prays
in his extremity to Mother Ganges, and she says, &ldquo;Now receive
from me this charm called &lsquo;forwards and backwards.&rsquo; If a
man repeats it forwards, he will become invisible to his neighbour; but

desires.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5964src" href="#xd21e5964"

take the liver out of a living child and eat it. But, in order to do
this effectively, she must first catch some particular kind of wild
animal not larger than a dog, feed it with cakes of sugar and butter,
ride on it, and repeat the charm one hundred times. When dying, the
breath will not leave the body of the witch until she has taught the
two and a half letters to another woman, or failing a woman, until she
has repeated it to a tree.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5967src" href=

<h3 class="main">Witchcraft by Means of Hair, Nail Parings, etc.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The idea is common in folk-lore that a witch can
acquire power over her victim by getting possession of a lock of hair,
the parings of his nails, or some other part of his body. In the
&ldquo;Comedy of Errors,&rdquo; Dromio of Syracuse says,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Some devils ask but the parings of one&rsquo;s
nail,</p>
<p class="line">A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,</p>

</div>
<p class="first">In Ireland, nail-parings are an ingredient in many
charms, and hair-cuttings should not be placed where birds can find
them, for they take them to build their nests, and then you will have
headaches all the year after.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5985src" href=
"#xd21e5985" name="xd21e5985src">54</a> The same is the case with the
leavings of food, which should be thrown to the crows lest some
ill-disposed person get possession of them. On the same principle
English mothers hide away <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href=

child.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5990src" href="#xd21e5990" name=
"xd21e5990src">55</a> There are numerous instances of these and similar
beliefs all through the whole range of folk-lore. Hence natives of
India are very careful about the disposal of hair-cuttings and
nail-parings; and it is only at shrines and sacred places of pilgrimage
where shaving is a religious duty that such things are left lying about
on the ground. In the Grihyas&ucirc;tras it is provided that the hair
cut from a child&rsquo;s head at the end of the first, third, fifth, or
seventh year shall be buried in the earth at a place covered with grass
or in the neighbourhood of water. The carelessness shown at places of
pilgrimage in this respect rests on the belief that the sanctity of the
place is in itself a protective against sorcery. But some people do not
depend on this, and fling the hair into running water. At Hardw&acirc;r
the barber at the sacred pool takes the hair which he keeps collected
in a bag and flings it into the air on the top of the neighbouring
hill, at least he assures his patrons that he does so.</p>

<h3 class="main">Witchcraft by Means of Images.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another means which witches are supposed to adopt in
order to injure those whom they dislike, is to make an image of wax,
flour, or similar substances, and torture it, with the idea that the
pain will be communicated to the person whom they desire to annoy.</p>
<p>Thus, among Muhammadans, when the death of an enemy is desired, a
doll is made of earth taken from a grave, or a place where bodies are
cremated, and various sentences of the Qur&acirc;n are read backwards
over twenty-one small wooden pegs. The officiant is to repeat the spell
three times over each peg, and is then to strike them so as to pierce
various parts of the body of the image. The image is then to be
shrouded like a corpse, conveyed to a cemetery, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span>and
buried in the name of the enemy whom it is intended to injure. He will,
it is believed, certainly die after this rite is performed. The
practice has become a branch of the fine arts and numerous methods are
detailed by Dr. Herklots.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6005src" href=
"#xd21e6005" name="xd21e6005src">56</a></p>
<p>It is almost unnecessary to say that similar ideas prevail in
Europe. The wounded Melun in &ldquo;King John&rdquo; says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Have I not hideous death within my view,</p>

</div>
<p class="first">An old woman in Cornwall was advised &ldquo;to buy a
bullock&rsquo;s heart, and get a packet of pound pins. She was to stick
the heart as full of pins as she could, and the body that wished her

had been run into her.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6021src" href=
"#xd21e6021" name="xd21e6021src">57</a> Examples of such images may be
seen in the Pitt-Rivers collection at Oxford. Sir W. Scott describes
how, under the threshold of a house in Dalkeith, was found the withered
heart of some animal, full of many scores of pins; and Aubrey tells us
of one Hammond, of Westminster, who was hanged or tried for his life in
1641 for killing a person by means of an image of wax. This was one of
the charges made against the unfortunate Jane Shore.<a class="noteref"

<p>In Bengal, &ldquo;a person sometimes takes a bamboo which has been
used to keep down a corpse during cremation, and making a bow and arrow
with it, repeats incantations over them. He then makes an image of his
enemy in clay, and lets fly an arrow into this image. The person whose
image is thus pierced is said to be immediately seized with a pain in
his breast.&rdquo; In the folk-tales restoration to life is usually
effected by collecting the ashes or bones of the deceased and making an
image of them, into which life is breathed.<a class="noteref" id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was a precept of Pythagoras not to run a nail or a
knife into a man&rsquo;s foot. This, from the primitive point of view,
was really a moral, not merely a prudential precept. For it is a
world-wide superstition that by injuring the footsteps you injure the
foot that made them. Thus, in Mecklenburgh it is thought that if you
thrust a nail into a man&rsquo;s footsteps the man will go lame. The
Australian blacks held exactly the same view. &ldquo;Seeing that a
Tutungolung was very lame,&rdquo; says Mr. Howitt, &ldquo;I asked him
what was the matter. He said, &lsquo;Some fellow has put bottle in my
foot.&rsquo; I asked him to let me see it. I found that he was probably
suffering from acute rheumatism. He explained that some enemy must have
found his foot-track, and have buried in it a piece of broken
bottle.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6040src" href="#xd21e6040"
name="xd21e6040src">60</a> The same feeling widely prevails in Northern
India, and rustics are in the habit of attributing all sorts of pains
and sores to the machinations of some witch or sorcerer who has meddled
with their footprints.</p>

<h3 class="main">Punishment of Witches.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The method by which witches are punished displays a
diabolical ingenuity. The Indian newspapers a short time ago recorded
six out of nine murders in the Sambalpur District as due to &ldquo;the
superstition, which is so general, that the spread of cholera is due to
the sorcery of some individual, whose evil influence can be nullified
if he be beaten with rods of the castor-oil plant. The people who are
thus suspected are so cruelly beaten that in the majority of cases they
die under the infliction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A milder form of treatment is to make the witch drink the filthy
water of a washerman&rsquo;s tank, which is believed to destroy her
skill.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6050src" href="#xd21e6050" name=
"xd21e6050src">61</a> The punishment in vogue in Central India was to
make witches drink the water used by curriers, leather being, as we
have seen, a scarer of evil spirits, and drinking such water involves
degradation from caste. In <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href=
"#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>more serious cases the
witch&rsquo;s nose was cut off, or she was put to death.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6055src" href="#xd21e6055" name=
"xd21e6055src">62</a></p>
<p>In Bastar, if a man is adjudged guilty of witchcraft, he is beaten
by the crowd, his hair is shaved, the hair being supposed to constitute
his power of mischief, his front teeth are knocked out, in order, it is
said, to prevent him from muttering incantations, or more probably, as
we have already seen, to prevent him from becoming a Loupgarou. All
descriptions of filth are thrown at him; if he be of good caste,
hog&rsquo;s flesh is thrust into his mouth, and lastly he is driven out
of the country, followed by the abuse and execrations of his
enlightened fellow-men. Women suspected of sorcery have to undergo the
same ordeal; if found guilty, the same punishment is awarded, and after
being shaved, their hair is attached to a tree in some public place. In
Chhatt&icirc;sgarh, a witch has her hair shaved with a blunt knife, her
two front teeth are knocked out, she is branded in the hinder parts,
has a ploughshare, which is a strong fetish, tied to her legs, and she
is made to drink the water of a tannery.<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In former times among the Dr&acirc;vidian races
persons denounced as witches were put to death in the belief that
witches breed witches and sorcerers. A terrible raid was made on these
unfortunate people when British authority was relaxed during the
Mutiny, and most atrocious murders were committed. &ldquo;Accusations

to be suspended from a tree head downwards, pounded chillies being
first put into the witch&rsquo;s eyes to see if the smarting would
bring tears from her. Sometimes after suspension she was swung
violently from side to side. She was finally compelled to drink the
blood <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=

regarded as a substitute for the sick man&rsquo;s life, and to satisfy
the witch&rsquo;s craving for blood. She was then brought to the
patient&rsquo;s bedside, and required to make passes over his head with
a N&icirc;m branch; a lock of hair was also cut from the head of the
witch and buried in the ground, that the last link between her and her

which the punishment of death or mutilation was inflicted on supposed
witches. He quotes a case in 1802, in which several of the witnesses
declared that they remembered numerous instances of persons being put
to death for sorcery; one of them, in particular, proved that her
mother had been tried and executed as a witch. In another case a Kol,
thinking that some old women had bewitched him, placed them in a line
and cut off all their heads, except that of the last, who, objecting to
this drastic form of ordeal, ran away and escaped. In another, the
nose-ring of a suspected witch was torn out with such violence as to
cause extensive laceration. There are recorded instances of even more
brutal forms of mutilation. A case occurred at Dh&acirc;ka in which
some people went to the house of a supposed witch, intending, as they
said, to make her discontinue her enchantments, and ill-treated her in
such a shameful way as to leave her in a dying state. She appears to
have been in the habit of prescribing medicine for children, and this
seems to have been the only basis for the reports that she practised
magic.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6081src" href="#xd21e6081" name=

<h3 class="main">Drawing Blood from a Witch.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One favourite way of counteracting the spells of a
witch is to draw blood from her. Thus, Professor Rhys, writing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>of Manxland, says: &ldquo;There is a belief that
if you can draw blood, however little, from a witch or one who has the
Evil Eye, he loses his power of harming you; and I have been told that
formerly this belief was sometimes acted on. Thus, on leaving church,
for instance, the man who fancied himself in danger from another would
go up to him, or walk by his side, and inflict on him a slight scratch
or some other trivial wound, which elicited blood.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6091src" href="#xd21e6091" name=
"xd21e6091src">67</a> In the First Part of &ldquo;Henry VI.&rdquo;
Talbot says to the Pucelle de Orleans,&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">So at the present day in Mirzapur, when a woman is
marked down as a witch, the Baiga or Ojha pricks her tongue with a
needle, and the blood thus extracted is received on some rice, which
she is compelled to eat. In another case she is pricked on the breast,
tongue, and thighs, and given the blood to drink. The ceremony is most
efficacious if performed on the banks of a running stream. This is
probably a survival of the actual blood sacrifice of a witch.</p>

twenty-five children died annually through the malevolence of witches.
These reputed witches used to drive a roaring trade, as women would
conceal their children on their approach and bribe them to go away. In
Gorakhpur, he says, the Tonahis or witches were very numerous,

<p class="first">At the present day the half-deified witch most dreaded
in the Eastern Districts of the North-Western Provinces is Lon&acirc;,
or Non&acirc;, a Cham&acirc;rin, or woman of the currier caste. Her
legend is in this wise. The great physician Dhanwantara, who
corresponds to Luqm&acirc;n Hak&icirc;m of the Muhammadans, was once on
his way to cure King Parikshit, and was deceived and bitten by the
snake king Takshaka. He therefore desired his son to roast him and eat
his flesh, and thus succeed to his magical powers. The snake king
dissuaded them from eating the unholy meal, and they let the cauldron
containing it float down the Ganges. A currier woman, named Lon&acirc;,
found it and ate the contents, and thus succeeded to the mystic powers
of Dhanwantara. She became skilful in cures, particularly of
snake-bite. Finally she was discovered to be a witch by the
extraordinary rapidity with which she could plant out rice seedlings.
One day the people watched her, and saw that when she believed herself
unobserved, she stripped herself naked, and taking the bundle of the
plants in her hands threw them into the air, reciting certain spells.
When the seedlings forthwith arranged themselves in their proper
places, the spectators called out in astonishment, and finding herself
discovered, Non&acirc; rushed along over the country, and the channel
which she made in her course is the Lon&icirc; river to this day. So a
saint in Broach formed a new course for a river by dragging his clothes
behind him. In Non&acirc;&rsquo;s case we have the nudity charm, of

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another terrible witch, whose legend is told at
Mathura, is P&ucirc;tan&acirc;, the daughter of Bali, king of the lower
world. She found the infant Krishna asleep, and began to suckle him
with her devil&rsquo;s milk. The first drop would have poisoned a
mortal child, but Krishna drew her breast with such strength that he
drained her life-blood, and the fiend, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb286" href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>terrifying the whole
land of Braj with her cries of agony, fell lifeless on the ground.
European witches suck the blood of children; here the divine Krishna
turns the tables on the witch.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6151src"

<h3 class="main">The Witch of the Palw&acirc;rs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Palw&acirc;r R&acirc;jputs of Oudh have a witch
ancestress. Soon after the birth of her son she was engaged in baking
cakes. Her infant began to cry, and she was obliged to perform a double
duty. At this juncture her husband arrived just in time to see his
demon wife assume gigantic and supernatural proportions, so as to allow
both the baking and nursing to go on at the same time. But finding her
secret discovered, the witch disappeared, leaving her son as a legacy
to her astonished husband.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6159src" href=
"#xd21e6159" name="xd21e6159src">73</a> Here, though the story is
incomplete, we have almost certainly, as in the case of Non&acirc;
Cham&acirc;rin, one of the Melusina type of legend, where the
supernatural wife leaves her husband and children, because he violated
some taboo, by which he is forbidden to see her in a state of nudity,
or the like.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6162src" href="#xd21e6162"
name="xd21e6162src">74</a></p>
<p>The history of witchcraft in India, as in Europe, is one of the
saddest pages in the annals of the people. Nowadays, the power of
British law has almost entirely suppressed the horrible outrages which,
under the native administration, were habitually practised. But
particularly in the more remote and uncivilized parts of the country,
this superstition still exists in the minds of the people, and
occasional indications of it, which appear in our criminal records, are
quite sufficient to show that any relaxation of the activity of our
magistrates and police would undoubtedly lead to its revival in some of
its more shocking forms. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href=

<p class="first">The subject of rural festivals is much too extensive
for treatment in a limited space. Here reference will be made only to a
few of those ceremonies which illustrate the principles recently
elucidated from the folk-lore of Europe by Messrs. Frazer, Gomme, and
Mannhardt.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6209src" href="#xd21e6209" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Akht&icirc;j.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The respect paid to ploughing is illustrated by the
early Vedic legend of S&icirc;t&acirc;, who, like the Etruscan Tago,
sprung from a furrow.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6220src" href=
"#xd21e6220" name="xd21e6220src">2</a> It is only in a later
development of the story that she becomes the daughter of Janaka, and
wife of R&acirc;ma Chandra.</p>
<p>The agricultural year in Northern India begins with the ceremony of
the Akht&icirc;j, &ldquo;the undecaying third,&rdquo; which is
celebrated on the third day of the light fortnight in the month of
Bais&acirc;kh, or May. In the North-Western Provinces the cultivator
first fees his Pandit to select an auspicious hour on that day for the
commencement of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288"
name="pb288">288</a>]</span>ploughing. In most places he does not begin
till 3 p.m.; in Mirzapur the time fixed is usually during the night, as
secrecy is in most of these rural ceremonies an important part of the
ritual.</p>
<p>In Rohilkhand the cultivator goes at daybreak to one of his fields,
which must be of a square or oblong shape. He takes with him a brass
drinking vessel of water, a branch of the Mango tree, both of which
are, as we have seen, efficacious in scaring spirits, and a spade. The
object of the rite is to propitiate Prithiv&icirc;, &ldquo;the broad
world,&rdquo; as contrasted with Dhart&icirc; M&acirc;&icirc;, or
&ldquo;Mother Earth,&rdquo; and Sesha N&acirc;ga, the great snake which
supports the world. Whenever Sesha yawns he causes an earthquake.</p>
<p>The Pandit first makes certain observations by which he is able to
determine in which direction the snake happens at the time to be lying,
because, in order to ease himself of his burden, he moves about beneath
the world, and lies, sometimes north and south, north-west and
south-east, and so on. This imaginary line having been marked off, the
peasant digs up five clods of earth with his spade. This is a lucky
number, as it is a quarter more than four. Hence Saw&acirc;i, or one
and a quarter, has been taken as one of the titles of the
Mah&acirc;r&acirc;ja of Jaypur. He then sprinkles water five times into
the trench with the branch of the sacred mango. The object of this is
by a form of sympathetic magic to ensure the productiveness of the
crop, and scare the demons of evil which would injure it. In Bombay, at
the beginning of the sowing season, a cocoanut is broken and thrown at
each side of the plough, so that the soil spirits may leave and make
room for Lakshm&icirc;, the goddess of prosperity, who is represented
by the plough.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6231src" href="#xd21e6231"
name="xd21e6231src">3</a> During all these proceedings the peasant
watches the omens most carefully, and if anything inauspicious happens,
the ceremony must be discontinued and recommenced at a luckier hour
later on in the day. When he gets home, some woman of the family, who
must not be a widow, who is naturally considered unlucky, presents him
with curds and silver for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href=
"#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>good luck. He then stays all day
in the house, rests, and does no work, and does not even go to sleep.
He avoids quarrels and disputes of all kinds, and on that day will give
neither grain nor money, nor fire to any one.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6236src" href="#xd21e6236" name="xd21e6236src">4</a> Next day he
eats sweet food and balls of wheaten flour, toasted with curds and
sugar, but carefully abstains from salt.</p>
<p>These usages have parallels in the customs of other lands. Thus, the
rule against giving fire on the sowing day prevailed in Rome, and is
still observed in the rural parts of England. In Iceland and the Isle
of Man it is believed that fire and salt are the most sacred things
given to man, and if you give them away on May Day you give away your
luck for the year; no one will give fire from a house while an
unbaptized baby is in it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6241src" href=
"#xd21e6241" name="xd21e6241src">5</a></p>
<p>In R&acirc;jput&acirc;na the custom is less elaborate. The first day
of ploughing after the rains begin is known as the Halsotiya festival.
Omens being favourable, the villagers proceed to the fields, each
household carrying a new earthen pot, coloured with turmeric, the
virtues of which have been already explained, and full of B&acirc;jra
millet. Looking to the north, the home of the gods, they make an
obeisance to the earth, and then a selected man ploughs five furrows.
The ploughman&rsquo;s hands and the bullock&rsquo;s hoofs are rubbed
with henna, and the former receives a dinner of delicacies.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6246src" href="#xd21e6246" name=
"xd21e6246src">6</a></p>
<p>In Mirzapur, only the northern part of the field, that facing the
Him&acirc;laya is dug up in five places with a piece of mango wood. The
peasant, when he goes home, eats rich food, and abstains from
quarrels.</p>
<p>All over the country the people seem to be becoming less careful
about these observances. Some, without consulting a Pandit at all, go
early to the field on the morning after the Hol&icirc; fire is lighted,
scratch the ground with a ploughshare, and on their return eat cakes
and sweetmeats. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290"
name="pb290">290</a>]</span>Others, on the first day after the
Hol&icirc;, when they hear the voice of the Koil, or Indian cuckoo at
twilight, go in silence to the field and make a few scratches.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6255src" href="#xd21e6255" name=
"xd21e6255src">7</a></p>
<p>Among the Dr&acirc;vidian Hill tribes of Mirzapur, the ceremony
seems to be merely a formal propitiation of the village godlings. Among
the Korwas, before ploughing commences, the Baiga makes an offering of
butter and molasses in his own field. This he burns in the name of the
village godlings, and does a special sacrifice at their shrine. After
this ploughing commences. The Kharw&acirc;rs, before sowing, take five
handfuls of grain from the sowing basket, and pray to Dhart&icirc;
M&acirc;t&acirc;, the earth goddess, to be propitious. They keep the
grain, grind it, and offer it at her annual festival in the month of
S&acirc;wan or August. The Pankas only do a burnt offering through the
Baiga, and offer up cakes and other food, known as N&ecirc;uj. Before
the spring sowing, a general offering of five cocks is made to the
village godlings by the Baiga, who consumes the sacrifice himself. All
these people do not commence agricultural work till the Baiga starts
work in his own field, and they prefer to do this on Monday.</p>
<p>In Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d the ceremony is somewhat different. The
ploughing is usually begun by the landlord, and all the cultivators
collect and assist at the ceremony in his field before they go on to
their own. &ldquo;It is the custom for him to take a rupee and fasten
it up in the leaf of the Pal&acirc;sa tree with a thorn. He also folds
up several empty leaves in the same way and covers them all with a heap
of leaves. When he has done worship to the plough and bullocks, he
yokes them and drives them through the heap, and all the cultivators
then scramble for the leaf which contains the rupee. They then each
plough their fields a little, and returning in a body, they are met by
the daughter or sister of the landlord, who comes out to meet them with
a brass vessel full of water, a light in one hand and the wheaten cakes
in the other. The landlord and each of the cultivators of his caste put
a rupee into her water vessel and take a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb291" href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>bit of the cake,
which they put on their heads. On the same day an earthen jar full of
water is taken by each cultivator to his threshing-floor, and placed to
stand on four lumps of earth, each of which bears the name of one of
the four months of the rainy season. Next morning as many lumps as are
wetted by the leaking of the water jar (which is very porous and always
leaks), so many months of rain will there be, and the cultivator makes
his arrangements for the sowing accordingly.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6264src" href="#xd21e6264" name="xd21e6264src">8</a></p>
<p>In the Him&acirc;laya, again, there is a different ritual: &ldquo;On
the day fixed for the commencement of ploughing the ceremony known as
Kudkhyo and Halkhyo takes place. The Kudkhyo takes place in the morning
or evening, and begins by lighting a lamp before the household deity
and offering rice, flowers, and balls made of turmeric, borax, and
lemon juice. The conch is then sounded, and the owner of the field or
relative whose lucky day it is, takes three or four pounds of
seed-grain from a basin and carries it to the edge of the field
prepared for its reception. He then scrapes a portion of the earth with
a mattock, and sows a part of the seed. One to five lamps are placed on
the ground, and the surplus seed is given away. At the Halkhyo
ceremony, the balls as above described are placed on the ploughman,
plough, and plough cattle; four or five furrows are ploughed and sown,
and the farm servants are fed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6270src" href="#xd21e6270" name="xd21e6270src">9</a> This custom
of giving away what remains of the seed-grain to labourers and beggars
prevails generally throughout Northern India.</p>
<p>A curious rite is performed in Kulu at the rice planting.
&ldquo;Each family in turn keeps open house. The neighbours, men and
women, collect at the rice-fields. As soon as a field is ready, the
women enter it in line, each with a bundle of young rice in her hands,
and advance dabbing the young plants into the slush as they go. The
mistress of the house and her daughters, dressed in their gayest, take
their stand in front of the line, and supply more bundles of plants as
they are wanted. The women sing in chorus as they work; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>impromptu verses are often put in, which
occasion a great deal of laughter. Two or three musicians are generally
entertained by the master of the house, who also supplies food and
drink of his best for the whole party. The day&rsquo;s work often ends
with a tremendous romp, in which every one throws mud at his
neighbours, or tries to give him or her a roll in it. No such ceremony
is observed in sowing other crops, rice having been formerly, in all
probability, the most important crop. It is also the custom to make a
rude image of a man in dough and to throw it away as a sacrifice to the
Ishta Deot&acirc; or household deity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6277src" href="#xd21e6277" name="xd21e6277src">10</a> This can
hardly be anything but a survival of an actual sacrifice to appease the
field godlings at sowing time. The rude horseplay which goes on is like
that at the Saturnalia and on the English Plough Monday.</p>
<p>Going on to the Dr&acirc;vidian races, the Mundas have a feast in
May at the time of sowing for the first rice crop. &ldquo;It is held in
honour of the ancestral shades and other spirits, who, if
unpropitiated, would prevent the seed from germinating. A he-goat and a
cock are sacrificed.&rdquo; Again in June they have a festival to
propitiate the local gods, that they may bless the crops. &ldquo;In the
Mund&acirc;ri villages everyone plants a branch of the Bel tree in his
land, and contributes to the general offering, which is made by the
priest in the sacred grove, a fowl, a pitcher of beer, and a handful of
rice.&rdquo; In July, again, each cultivator sacrifices a fowl, and
after some mysterious rites, a wing is stripped off and inserted in a
cleft of a bamboo, and stuck up in the rice-field or dung-heap. If this
is omitted, the rice crop, it is supposed, will not come to maturity.
It appears more like a charm than a sacrifice. Among the Kols of Chota
N&acirc;gpur, there is a special dance, &ldquo;the women follow the men
and change their attitudes and positions in obedience to signals from
them.&rdquo; In one special figure &ldquo;the women all kneel and pat
the ground with their hands, in tune of music, as if coaxing the earth
to be fertile.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6282src" href=

<h3 class="main">Prohibition of Ploughing.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A clergyman in Devonshire informed Brand that the old
farmers in his parish called the three first days of March &ldquo;Blind
Days,&rdquo; which were anciently considered unlucky, and on them no
farmer would sow his seed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6292src" href=
"#xd21e6292" name="xd21e6292src">12</a></p>
<p>In Northern India there are certain days on which ploughing is
forbidden, such as the N&acirc;gpancham&icirc; or snake feast held on
the fifth of the light half of S&acirc;wan, and the fifteenth of the
month K&acirc;rttik. Turning up the soil on such days disturbs
Seshan&acirc;ga, the great world serpent and Mother Earth. But Mother
Earth is also supposed to sleep on six days in every month&mdash;the
5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 21st, and 24th; or, as others say, the 1st, 2nd,
5th, 7th, 10th, 21st, and 24th. On such days it is inadvisable to
plough if it can be possibly avoided. The fifteen days in the month of
Ku&acirc;r which are devoted to the worship of the Pitri or sainted
dead, are also an inauspicious time for agricultural work.</p>
<p>All these ceremonies at the commencement of the agricultural season
remind us in many ways of the observance of the festivals of Plough
Monday and similar customs in rural England.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">The Rakshabandhan and J&acirc;y&icirc; Festivals.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have already noticed the use of the knotted cord or
string as an amulet. On the full moon of S&acirc;wan is held the Salono
or Rakshabandhan festival, when women tie these amulets round the
wrists of their friends. Connected with this is what is known as the
barley feast, the J&acirc;y&icirc; or Jaw&acirc;ra of Upper India, and
the Bhujariya of the Central Provinces. It is supposed to be connected
in some way with the famous story of Alha and Udal, which forms the
subject of a very popular local epic. They were R&acirc;jputs of the
Ban&acirc;phar clan, and led the Chandels in their famous campaign
against the R&acirc;htaurs of Kanauj, which immediately preceded, and
in fact led up to, the Muhammadan conquest of Northern India.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6307src" href="#xd21e6307" name=
"xd21e6307src">14</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href=
"#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span></p>
<p>In connection with this simple rural feast, a most elaborate ritual
has been prescribed under Br&acirc;hmanical influence, but all that is
usually done is that on the seventh day of the light half of
S&acirc;wan, grains of barley are sown in a pot of manure, and spring
up so rapidly that by the end of the month the vessel is full of long,
yellowish-green stalks. On the first day of the next month,
Bh&acirc;don, the women and girls take these out, throw the earth and
manure into water, and distribute the plants to their male friends, who
bind them in their turbans and about their dress.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6313src" href="#xd21e6313" name="xd21e6313src">15</a></p>
<p>We have already come across an instance of a similar practice among
the Kharw&acirc;rs at the Karama festival, and numerous examples of the
same have been collected by Mr. Frazer.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6321src" href="#xd21e6321" name="xd21e6321src">16</a> Thus,
&ldquo;in various parts of Italy and all over Sicily it is still
customary to put plants in water or in earth on the Eve of St. John,
and from the manner in which they are found to be blooming or faded on
St. John&rsquo;s Day omens are drawn, especially as to fortune in love.
In Prussia two hundred years ago the farmers used to send out their
servants, especially their maids, to gather St. John&rsquo;s wort on
Midsummer Eve or Midsummer Day. When they had fetched it, the farmer
took as many plants as there were persons and stuck them on the wall or
between the beams; and it was thought that the person whose plant did
not bloom would soon fall sick or die. The rest of the plants were tied
in a bundle, fastened to the end of a pole, and set up at the gate or
wherever the corn would be brought in at the next harvest. This bundle
was called Kupole, the ceremony was known as Kupole&rsquo;s festival,
and at it the farmer prayed for a good crop of hay, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have the same idea in the English rural custom of &ldquo;wearing
the rose.&rdquo; There can be no reasonable doubt that all these rites
were intended to propitiate the spirit of vegetation and promote the
germination and growth of the next crop.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">The Diw&acirc;l&icirc;, or Feast of Lamps.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The regular Diw&acirc;l&icirc;, or Feast of Lamps,
which is performed on the last day of the dark fortnight in the month
of K&acirc;rttik, is more of a city than a rural festival. But even in
the villages everyone burns a lamp outside the house on that night.</p>
<p>The feast has, of course, been provided with an appropriate legend.
Once upon a time an astrologer foretold to a R&acirc;ja that on the new
moon of K&acirc;rttik his K&acirc;l, or fate, would appear at midnight
in the form of a snake; that the way to avoid this was that he should
order all his subjects on that night to keep their houses, streets, and
lanes clean; that there should be a general illumination; that the
king, too, should place a lamp at his door, and at the four corners of
his couch, and sprinkle rice and sweetmeats everywhere.</p>
<p>If the door-lamp went out it was foretold that he would become
insensible, and that he was to tell his R&acirc;n&icirc; to sing the
praises of the snake when it arrived. These instructions were carefully
carried out, and the snake was so pleased with his reception, that he
told the R&acirc;n&icirc; to ask any boon she pleased. She asked for
long life for her husband. The snake replied that it was out of his
power to grant this, but that he would make arrangements with
Yamar&acirc;ja, the lord of the dead, for the escape of her husband,
and that she was to continue to watch his body.</p>
<p>Then the snake carried off the spirit of the king to Yamar&acirc;ja.
When the papers of the king&rsquo;s life were produced before
Yamar&acirc;ja his age was denoted by a cipher, but the kindly snake
put a seven before it, and thus raised his age to seventy years. Then
Yamar&acirc;ja said: &ldquo;I find that this person has still seventy
years to live. Take him back at once.&rdquo; So the snake brought back
the soul of the king, and he revived and lived for seventy years more,
and established this feast in honour of the event. Much the same idea
appears in one of Grimm&rsquo;s German tales.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6345src" href="#xd21e6345" name="xd21e6345src">18</a></p>
<p>The original basis of the feast seems to have been the idea
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span>that on this night the spirits of the dead
revisit their homes, which are cleaned and lighted for their reception.
Now it is chiefly observed in honour of Lakshm&icirc;, the goddess of
wealth and good luck, who is propitiated by gambling. On this night the
women make what is called &ldquo;the new moon lampblack&rdquo;
(<i>Am&acirc;was K&acirc; K&acirc;jal</i>), which is used throughout
the following year as a charm against the Evil Eye, and, as we have
already seen, the symbolical expulsion of poverty goes on.</p>
<p>Immediately following this festival is the Bhaiyya D&ucirc;j, or
&ldquo;Brothers&rsquo; second,&rdquo; when sisters make a mark on the
foreheads of their brothers and cause them to eat five grains of gram.
These must be swallowed whole, not chewed, and bring length of days.
The sister then makes her brother sit facing the east, and feeds him
with sweetmeats, in return for which he gives her a present.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Govardhan.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Following the Diw&acirc;l&icirc; comes what is known
as the Govardhan, or Godhan, which is a purely rural feast. In parts of
the North-Western Provinces, the women, on a platform outside the
house, make a little hut of mud and images of Gaur&icirc; and Ganesa;
there they place the parched grain which the girls offered on the night
of the Diw&acirc;l&icirc;; near it they lay some thorny grass, wave a
rice pounder round the hut, and invoke blessings on their relations and
friends. This is also a cattle feast, and cowherds come round half
drunk and collect presents from their employers. They sing, &ldquo;May
this house grow as the sugar-cane grows, as Ganga increases at the
sacred confluence of Pray&acirc;g!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Panj&acirc;b &ldquo;the women make a Govardhan of cowdung,
which consists of Krishna lying on his back surrounded with little
cottage loaves of dung to represent mountains, in which are stuck stems
of grass with tufts of cotton or rag on the top for trees, and by
little dung balls for cattle, watched by dung men dressed in little
bits of rag. Another opinion is that the cottage loaves are cattle, and
the dung balls calves. On this they put the churn-staff, five white
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>sugar-canes, some parched rice, and a lamp in
the middle. The cowherds are then called in, and they salute the whole,
and are fed with rice and sweets. The Br&acirc;hman then takes the
sugar-cane and eats a bit, and till then no one must eat, cut, or press
cane. Rice-milk is then given to the Br&acirc;hmans, and the bullocks
have their horns dyed and are extra well fed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6366src" href="#xd21e6366" name="xd21e6366src">19</a></p>
<p>The Emperor Akbar, we are told, used to join in this
festival.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6371src" href="#xd21e6371" name=
"xd21e6371src">20</a></p>
<p>The custom in Cawnpur, known as the D&acirc;ng, or
&ldquo;Club,&rdquo; Diw&acirc;l&icirc; is very similar. The cowherds
worship Govardhan in the form of a little heap of cowdung decorated
with cotton, and go round to the houses of the persons whose cattle
they graze, dance to the music of two sticks beaten together and a drum
played by a Hindu weaver, and get presents of grain, cloth, or
money.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6376src" href="#xd21e6376" name=

in Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d they have the rite of frightening the
cattle. &ldquo;Everyone keeps awake all night, and the herdsmen go out
begging in a body, singing, and keeping the cattle from sleeping. In
the morning they are all stamped with the hand dipped in yellow paint
for the white ones, and white paint for the red ones, and strings of
cowries or peacocks&rsquo; feathers are tied to their horns. Then they
are driven out with wild whoops or yells, and the herdsman standing at
the doorway smashes an earthen water jar on the last. The neck of this
is placed on the gateway leading to the cattle sheds, and preserves
them from the Evil Eye. In the afternoon the cattle are all collected
together, and the Parih&acirc;r priest sprinkles them with water, after
which they are secure from all possible evil.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6384src" href="#xd21e6384" name="xd21e6384src">22</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span></p>
<p>This reminds us of the custom of Manx cattle dealers, who drive
their herd through fire on May Day, so as to singe them a little, and
preserve them from harm.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6390src" href=
"#xd21e6390" name="xd21e6390src">23</a> The same was probably the
origin of the bull-running in the town of Stamford of which Brand gives
an account. So the Chinese make an effigy of an ox in clay, which after
being beaten by the governor, is stoned by the people till they break
it in pieces, from which they expect an abundant year.</p>
<p>We have already met with instances where the scape animal merges in
a sacrifice. In Garhw&acirc;l, at the sacrifice in honour of
Dev&icirc;, the Br&acirc;hmans make a circle of flour filled with
various sorts of colours. Inside this they sit and repeat sacred
verses. Then a male buffalo is made to move round the circle seven
times, and everyone throws some holy rice and oats over it. After this
the headman of the village strikes it lightly on the back with a sword
and makes it run, on which the people follow and hack it to pieces with
their swords.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6395src" href="#xd21e6395"
name="xd21e6395src">24</a></p>
<p>So in Bengal, on the last day of the month K&acirc;rttik
(October-November) a pig is turned loose among a herd of buffaloes, who
are encouraged to gore it to death. The carcase is given to the
Dus&acirc;dh village menials to eat. The Ah&icirc;rs, who practise this
strange rite, aver that it has no religious significance, and is merely
a sort of popular amusement. They do not themselves partake of any part
of the pig.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6400src" href="#xd21e6400" name=
"xd21e6400src">25</a> It is plainly a survival of a regular sacrifice,
probably intended to promote the fertility of the herds and crops.</p>
<p>Similar customs for the protection of cattle prevail in other parts
of the country. Thus, in Mirzapur, at the Diw&acirc;l&icirc;, a little
earthen bell is procured from the village potter, and hung round the
necks of the cattle as a protective.</p>
<p>In Ber&acirc;r, at the Pola festival, the bullocks of the whole
village pass in procession under a sacred rope made of twisted grass
and covered with mango leaves. The sacred pole of the headman is then
borne aloft to the front. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href=
"#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>gives the order to advance, and
all the bullocks, his own leading the way, file under the rope
according to the respective rank of their owners. The villagers vie
with each other in having the best decorated and painted bullocks, and
large sums are often expended in this way. This rope is supposed to
possess the magic power of protecting the cattle from disease and
accident.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6409src" href="#xd21e6409" name=
"xd21e6409src">26</a></p>
<p>In Northern India it is a common charm to drive the cattle under a
rope fixed over the village cattle path, and among the Dr&acirc;vidians
of Mirzapur, two poles and a cross bar are fixed at the entrance of the
village with the same object. The charm is rendered more powerful if a
plough beam is sunk in the ground close by.</p>
<p>The custom of the silent tending of cattle has been already
mentioned. At the cattle festival in R&acirc;jput&acirc;na, in the
evening the cow is worshipped, the herd having been previously tended.
&ldquo;From this ceremony no rank is excepted; on the preceding day,
dedicated to Krishna, prince and peasant all become pastoral attendants
of the cow in the form of Prithiv&icirc; or the Earth.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6416src" href="#xd21e6416" name=
"xd21e6416src">27</a> In some places the flowers and other ornaments of
the cattle, which they lose in their wild flight, are eagerly picked up
and treated as relics bringing good fortune. We have a similar idea in
the blessing of cattle in Italy,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6419src"
href="#xd21e6419" name="xd21e6419src">28</a> and this is probably the
origin of the observance described by Aubrey, when &ldquo;in
Somersetshire, where the wassaile (which is, I think, Twelfe Eve), the
ploughmen have their Twelfe cake, and they go into the ox-house to the
cattle, and drink to the ox with the crumpled horn that treads out the

<h3 class="main">The Sleep of Vishnu.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">According to the rural belief, Vishnu sleeps for four
months in the year, from the eleventh of the bright half of the month
As&acirc;rh, the Deosoni Ek&acirc;dash&icirc;, &ldquo;the reposing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>of the god,&rdquo; till the eleventh of the
bright half of the month K&acirc;rttik, the Deoth&acirc;n, or
&ldquo;god&rsquo;s awakening.&rdquo; So the demon Kumbha Karana in the
R&acirc;m&acirc;yana when he is gorged sleeps for six months. According
to Mr. Campbell,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6432src" href="#xd21e6432"
name="xd21e6432src">30</a> during these four months while the god
sleeps demons are abroad, and hence there are an unusual number of
protective festivals in that period. On the day he retires to rest
women mark the house with lines of cowdung as a safeguard, fast during
the day, and eat sweetmeats at night. During the four months of the
god&rsquo;s rest it is considered unlucky to marry, repair the thatch
of a hut, or make the house cots. His rising at the Deoth&acirc;n marks
the commencement of the sugar-cane harvest, when the cane mill is
marked with red paint, and lamps are lighted upon it. The owner of the
crop then does worship in his field, and breaks off some stalks of
sugar-cane, which he puts on the boundary. He distributes five canes
each to the village Br&acirc;hman, blacksmith, carpenter, washerman,
and water carrier, and takes five home.</p>
<p>Then on a wooden board about one and a half feet long two figures of
Vishnu and his wife Lakshm&icirc; are drawn with lines of butter and
cowdung. On the board are placed some cotton, lentils, water-nuts, and
sweets; a fire sacrifice is offered, and the five canes are placed near
the board and tied together at the top. The S&acirc;lagr&acirc;ma, or
stone emblematical of Vishnu, is lifted up, and all sing a rude melody,
calling on the god to wake and join the assembly. &ldquo;Then all move
reverently round the emblems, the tops of the cane are broken off and
hung on the roof till the Hol&icirc;, when they are burnt. When the
worship has been duly performed, and the officiating Br&acirc;hman has
declared that the fortunate moment has arrived, the cutting may
commence. The whole village is a scene of festivity, and dancing and
singing go on frantically. Till this day no Hindu will eat or touch the
crop. They believe that even jackals will not eat the cane till then.
The real fact is that till then the juice has not properly come up, and
the cane is not worth eating. On <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301"
href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>the first day the cane is cut
the owner eats none of it, it would bring him bad luck.&rdquo;<a class=

<h3 class="main">Ceremonies to Avert Blight, etc.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are various ceremonies intended to save certain
crops from the ravages of blight and insects. Blight is very generally
attributed to the constant measurement of the soil which goes on during
settlement operations, to the irreligious custom of eating beef, or to
adultery, or to a demon of the east wind, who can be appeased with
prayers and ceremonies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6448src" href=
"#xd21e6448" name="xd21e6448src">32</a> No pious Hindu, if the seed
fails, will re-sow his winter crop.</p>
<p>When sugar-cane germinates, the owner of the crop does worship on
the next Saturday before noon. On one of the days of the
Naur&acirc;tr&icirc; in the month of Ku&acirc;r the cultivator himself,
or through his family priest, burns a fire sacrifice in the field and
offers prayers. In the month of K&acirc;rttik he has a special ceremony
to avert a particularly dangerous grub, known as the S&ucirc;ndi. For
this purpose he takes from his house butter, cakes, sweets, and five or
six lumps of dough pressed into the shape of a pear, with some clean
water. He goes to the field, offers a fire sacrifice, and presents some
of the cakes to the field spirit. He then buries one of the lumps of
dough at each corner of his field, and, having eaten the rest of the
cakes, goes home happy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6453src" href=
"#xd21e6453" name="xd21e6453src">33</a></p>
<p>When field-mice do injury to the crop the owner goes to a
Sy&acirc;na, or cunning man, who writes a charm, the letters of which
he dissolves in water and scatters it over the plants. The ancient
Greek farmer was recommended to proceed as follows: &ldquo;Take a sheet
of paper and write on it these words, &lsquo;Ye mice here present, I
adjure ye that ye injure me not, neither suffer another mouse to injure
me. I give you yonder field (specifying the field), but if ever I catch
you here again, by the help of the Mother of the gods, I will rend you
in seven pieces.&rsquo; Write this and stick the paper on an unhewn
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>stone in the field where the mice are, taking
care to keep the written side uppermost.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6460src" href="#xd21e6460" name="xd21e6460src">34</a></p>
<p>General Sleeman gives a case of a cowherd who saw in a vision that
the water of the Biy&acirc;s river should be taken up in pitchers and
conveyed to the fields attacked with blight, but that none of it should
be allowed to fall on the ground in the way. On reaching the field a
small hole should be made in the bottom of the pitcher so as to keep up
a small but steady stream, as the bearer carried it round the border of
the field, so that the water might fall in a complete ring except at a
small opening which was to be kept dry, so that the demon of the blight
could make his escape through it. Crowds of people came to fetch the
water, which was not supposed to have any particular virtue except that
arising from this revelation.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6465src" href=

<h3 class="main">Scaring of Locusts.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Locusts, one of the great pests of the Indian
peasant&rsquo;s life, are scared by shouting, lighting of fires,
beating of brass pots, and in particular, by ringing the temple bell.
In Sirsa, the Karwa, a flying insect which injures the flower of the
B&acirc;jra millet, is expelled by a man taking his sister&rsquo;s son
on his shoulder and feeding him with rice-milk while he repeats the
following charm: &ldquo;The nephew has mounted his uncle&rsquo;s
shoulder. Go, Karwa, to some other field!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6473src" href="#xd21e6473" name="xd21e6473src">36</a></p>
<p>In the Panj&acirc;b a popular legend thus explains the enmity
between the starling and the locust. Once upon a time the locusts used
to come and destroy the crops as they were ripening. The people prayed
to N&acirc;r&acirc;yana, and he imprisoned them in a deep valley in the
Him&acirc;laya, putting the starlings to keep them in confinement. Now
and again the locusts try to escape and the starlings promptly put them
to death. The legend is probably based on the fact that both the
starlings and the locusts come from the Hills, and about the same
time.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6478src" href="#xd21e6478" name=
"xd21e6478src">37</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href=
"#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another device to scare them is based on the well-known principle of
treating with high distinction one or two chosen individuals of the
obnoxious species, while the rest are pursued with relentless vigour.
&ldquo;In the East Indian island of Bali, the mice which ravage the
rice-fields are caught in great numbers and burnt in the same way that
corpses are burnt. But two of the captured mice are allowed to live and
receive a little packet of white linen. Then the people bow down before
them, as before gods, and let them go.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6484src" href="#xd21e6484" name="xd21e6484src">38</a> So in
Mirzapur the Dr&acirc;vidian tribes, when a flight of locusts comes,
catch one, decorate its head with a spot of red lead, salaam to it, and
let it go, when the whole flight immediately departs.</p>

<h3 class="main">Betel Planting.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When cultivators in the North-Western Provinces sow
betel, they cook rice-milk near the plants and offer it to the local
godling. They divide the offering, and a little coarse sugar is
dedicated to Mah&acirc;b&icirc;r, the monkey god, which is taken home
and distributed among the children. This is known as Jeon&acirc;r
P&ucirc;j&acirc; or &ldquo;the banquet rite.&rdquo; The Barais, who
make a speciality of cultivating the plant, have two godlings of their
own, Sokha B&acirc;ba, the ghost of some famous magician, and
N&acirc;gbeli, the &ldquo;creeper N&acirc;ga,&rdquo; or snake, who is
connected with the sinuous growth of the tendrils.</p>
<p>In Bengal, the Baruis, a similar caste, worship their patron goddess
on the fourth day of the month Bais&acirc;kh with offerings of flowers,
rice, sweetmeats, and sandal-wood paste. Some do the Navam&icirc;
P&ucirc;j&acirc; in honour of Ushas, or the Aurora, on the sixth day of
the waning moon in Asin. Plantains, rice, sugar, and sweetmeats are
placed in the centre of the garden, from which the worshippers retire,
but after a little time return, and carrying out the offerings,
distribute them among the village children. In Bikrampur,
Sunj&acirc;&icirc;, a form of Bh&acirc;gawat&icirc;, is worshipped.</p>
<p>They do not employ Br&acirc;hmans in the worship, because, they say,
a Br&acirc;hman was the first cultivator of betel. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>Through his neglect the plant grew so high that
he used his sacred thread to fasten up the tendrils, but as it still
shot up faster than he could supply thread, its charge was given to a
K&acirc;yasth or writer. Hence it is that a Br&acirc;hman cannot enter
a betel garden without defilement.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6498src"
href="#xd21e6498" name="xd21e6498src">39</a> In another form of the
story, the thread of the Br&acirc;hman grew up to the sky and became a
betel tendril. So, in a Tartar story, the hop plant originates from the
bow-string of a man that had been turned into a bear.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6501src" href="#xd21e6501" name="xd21e6501src">40</a></p>
<p>All over India, the betel plant, perhaps on account of the delicacy
of its growth, is considered as being very susceptible to demoniacal
influence, and a woman or a person in a state of ceremonial pollution
is excluded from the nursery. We meet with an instance of the same idea
among the Ainos. &ldquo;They prepare for the fishing by observing rules
of ceremonial purity, and when they have gone out to fish the women at
home must keep strict silence, or the fish would hear them and
disappear. When the first fish is caught he is brought home and passed
through a small opening at the end of the hut, but not through the
door; for if he were passed through the door, the other fish would
certainly see him and disappear.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6506src" href="#xd21e6506" name="xd21e6506src">41</a></p>
<p>All these protective measures intended to guard the crop from
defilement and demoniacal influence are rather like the old English
rule of the young men and girls walking round the corn to bless it on
Palm Sunday, an observance which Audley drily remarks in his time
&ldquo;gave many a conception.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When sugar-cane is being planted, the sower is
decorated with silver ornaments, a necklace, flowers, and a red mark is
made on his forehead. It is considered a favourable omen if a man on
horseback come into the field while the sowing is going on. After the
sowing is completed, all the men <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305"
href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span>employed come home to the
farmer&rsquo;s house and have a good dinner.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6521src" href="#xd21e6521" name="xd21e6521src">43</a> All surplus
seed is carefully destroyed with fire, as it is believed that the
plants grown from it would be worthless and produce only flowers and
seed.</p>
<p>In the Panj&acirc;b, on the first day of sowing, sweetened rice is
brought to the field, the women smear the outside of the vessel with
it, and it is then distributed to the workmen. Next morning a woman
puts on a necklace and walks round the field, winding thread on a
spindle. This forms a sacred circle which repels evil influence from
the crop. On the night of the Deoth&acirc;n, when Vishnu wakes from his
four months&rsquo; sleep, lamps are lighted on the cane mill, and it is
smeared with daubs of red paint.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6526src"

<h3 class="main">Cotton Planting.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the cotton has sprung up, the owner of the field
goes there on Sunday forenoon with some butter, sweetmeats, and cakes.
He burns a fire sacrifice, offers up some of the food, and eats the
remainder in silence. Here we have another instance of the taboo
against speaking, which so commonly appears in these rural
ceremonies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6534src" href="#xd21e6534" name=
"xd21e6534src">45</a></p>
<p>When the cotton comes into flower, some parched rice is taken to the
field on a Wednesday or Friday; some is thrown broadcast over the
plants, and the rest given to children, the object assigned being that
the bolls may swell, as the rice does when parched. Many instances of
symbolical or sympathetic magic of the same kind might be collected
from the usages of other races. Thus, for instance, in Sumatra, the
rice is sown by women, who, in sowing, let their hair hang loose down
their back, in order that the rice may grow luxuriantly and have long
stalks.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6539src" href="#xd21e6539" name=
"xd21e6539src">46</a></p>
<p>When the cotton is ripe and ready for picking, the women pickers go
to the north or east quarters of the field with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>parched rice and sweetmeats. These directions
are, of course, selected with reference to the Him&acirc;laya, the home
of the gods, and the rising sun. They pick two or three large pods, and
then sit down and pull out the cotton in as long a string as possible
without breaking it. They hang these threads on the largest cotton
plant they can find in the field, round which they sit, and fill their
mouths as full as possible with the parched rice, which they blow out
as far as they can in each direction; the idea being, of course, the
same as in the ceremony when the plant flowers. A fire offering is made
and the picking commences.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6546src" href=
"#xd21e6546" name="xd21e6546src">47</a></p>
<p>The custom in Karn&acirc;l is very similar. When the pods open and
the cotton is ready for picking, the women go round the field eating
rice-milk, the first mouthful of which they spit on the field towards
the west. The first cotton picked is exchanged for its weight in salt,
which is prayed over and kept in the house till the picking is over,
when it is distributed among the members of the household and
friends.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6551src" href="#xd21e6551" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d, when the reaping is nearly
over, a small patch of corn is left standing in the last field, and the
reapers rest a little. Then they rush at this piece, tear it up, and
cast it in the air, shouting victory to their deities, Omk&acirc;r
Mah&acirc;r&acirc;ja, Jhamaj&icirc;, R&acirc;mj&icirc; D&acirc;s, or
other local godlings according to their persuasions. A sheaf is made of
this corn, which is tied to a bamboo, stuck up on the last harvest
cart, carried home in triumph, and fastened up at the threshing-floor
or to a tree, or on the cattle shed, where its services are essential
in averting the Evil Eye.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6559src" href=
"#xd21e6559" name="xd21e6559src">49</a></p>
<p>The same custom prevails in the eastern districts of the
North-Western Provinces. Sometimes a little patch in the corner of the
field is left untilled as a refuge for the field spirit; sometimes it
is sown and the corn reaped with a rush <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>and shout and given
to the Baiga as an offering to the local godlings, or distributed among
beggars.</p>
<p>This is a most interesting analogue of a branch of European
folk-lore which has been copiously illustrated by Mr. Frazer.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6568src" href="#xd21e6568" name=
"xd21e6568src">50</a> It is the Devon custom of &ldquo;Crying the

in the reservation of small patches of the original forest for the
accommodation of the spirits of the jungle.</p>

<p class="first">There are many customs connected with the disposal of
the first-fruits of the crop. The eating of the new grain is attended
with various observances, in which the feeding of Br&acirc;hmans and
beggars takes a prominent place. In K&acirc;ngra, the first-fruits of
corn, oil, and wine, and the first fleece of the sheep are not indeed
actually given, but a symbolical offering is made in their stead. These
offerings are made to the J&acirc;k or field spirit to whom reference
has already been made. The custom has now reached a later stage, for
the local R&acirc;ja puts the right of receiving the offerings on

houses are supported by cylindrical or square pillars of wood, the top
of which, under the truss, is, in the houses of the peasantry,
encircled by a band of straw and ears of wheat, forming a primitive
sort of capital. It is the custom, I was told, to consecrate the two or
three first handsful of each year&rsquo;s crop to the spirit who
presides over agriculture, and these bands are thus deposited.
Sometimes rams&rsquo; horns are added to this

made is presented to friends or beggars, as is the first bowl of the

who from this probably gains his title of Shakkarganj, or
&ldquo;Treasury of sugar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sant&acirc;ls have a harvest-home feast in December, at which
the Jag M&acirc;njhi, or headman of the village, entertains the people.
The cattle are anointed with oil and daubed over with vermilion, and a
share of rice-beer is given to each animal.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Everywhere in treading out the grain the rule that the cattle move
round the stake in the course of the sun is rigidly observed.</p>

<h3 class="main">Ceremonies at Winnowing.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Winnowing is a very serious and solemn operation, not
lightly to be commenced without due consultation of the stars.</p>
<p>In Hoshang&acirc;b&acirc;d, when the village priest has fixed a
favourable time, the cultivator, his whole family, and his labourers go
to the threshing-floor, taking with them the prescribed articles of
worship, such as milk, butter, turmeric, boiled wheat, and various
kinds of grain. The threshing-floor stake is washed in water, and these
things are offered to it and to the pile of threshed grain. The boiled
wheat is scattered about in the hope that the Bh&ucirc;ts or spirits
may content themselves with it and not take any of the harvested corn.
Then the master stands on a three-legged stool, and taking five
basketsful from the threshed heap, winnows them. After winnowing, the
grain and chaff are collected again and measured; if the five baskets
are turned out full, or anything remains over, it is a good omen. If
they cannot fill the baskets, the place where they began winnowing is
considered unlucky and it is removed a few yards to another part of the
threshing-floor. The five basketsful are presented <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>to a
Br&acirc;hman, or distributed in the village, not mixed with the rest
of the harvest.</p>
<p>Winnowing can then go on as convenient, but one precaution must be
taken. As long as winnowing goes on the basket must never be set down
on its bottom, but always upside down. If this were not done, the
spirits would use the basket to carry off the grain. The day&rsquo;s
results are measured generally in the evening. This is done in perfect
silence, the measurer sitting with his back to the unlucky quarter of
the sky, and tying knots to keep count of the number of the baskets.
The spirits rob the grain until it is measured, but when once it has
been measured they are afraid of detection.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6606src" href="#xd21e6606" name="xd21e6606src">54</a></p>
<p>In the Eastern Panj&acirc;b, the clean grain is collected into a
heap. Preparatory to measuring, the greatest care has to be observed in
the preparation of this heap, or evil spirits will diminish the yield.
One man sits facing the north, and places two round balls of cowdung on
the ground. Between them he sticks in a plough-coulter, a symbol known
as Sh&acirc;od M&acirc;t&acirc; or &ldquo;the mother of
fertility.&rdquo; A piece of the &Acirc;kh or swallow-wort and some
D&ucirc;b grass are added, and they salute it, saying: &ldquo;O Mother
Sh&acirc;od! Give the increase! Make our bankers and rulers
contented!&rdquo; The man then carefully hides the image of Sh&acirc;od
from all observers while he covers it up with grain, which the others
throw over his head from behind. When it is well covered, they pile the
grain upon it, but three times during the process the ceremony of
Ch&acirc;ng is performed. The man stands to the south of the heap and
goes round it towards the west the first and third time, and the
reverse way the second time. As he goes round, he has the hand furthest
from the heap full of grain, and in the other a winnowing fan, with
which he taps the heap. When the heap is finished they sprinkle it with
Ganges water, and put a cloth over it till it is time to measure the
grain. A line is then drawn on the ground all round the heap, inside
which none but the measurer must <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310"
href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span>go. All these operations must
be performed in profound silence.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6613src"
href="#xd21e6613" name="xd21e6613src">55</a></p>
<p>In Bareilly, when the whole of the grain and chaff has been
winnowed, all the dressed grain is collected into a heap. &ldquo;The
winnower, with his basket in his right hand, goes from the south
towards the west, and then towards the north, till he reaches the pole
to which the treading-out cattle have been tethered. He then returns
the same way, goes to the east till he reaches the pole, and back again
to the south; then he places the basket on the ground and utters some
pious ejaculation. Then an iron sickle, a stick of the sacred Kusa
grass, and a bit of swallow-wort, with a cake of cowdung in a cleft
stick, are placed on the heap, and four cakes of cowdung at the four
corners; and a line is traced round it with cowdung. A fire offering is
then made, and some butter and coarse sugar are offered as sacrifice.
Water is next thrown round the piled grain and the remainder of the
sugar distributed to those present.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6618src" href="#xd21e6618" name="xd21e6618src">56</a></p>
<p>In the Etah District, the owner of the field places to the north of
the pile of grain a threshing-floor rake, a bullock&rsquo;s muzzle, and
a rope at a distance of three spans from the piled grain; and between
these things and the pile he lays a little offering consisting of a few
ears of grain, some leaves of the swallow-wort, and a few flowers.
These things are laid on a piece of cowdung. He then covers the pile of
grain with a cloth to protect it from thieving Bh&ucirc;ts, and puts in
a basket three handfuls of grain as the perquisite of the village
priest who lights the Hol&icirc; fire. Something is also laid by for
the village beggars. Then he sprinkles a little grain on the cloth, and
fills a basket full of grain which he pours back on the pile as an
emblem of increase. He then bows to the gods who live in the northern
hills, and mutters a prayer; it is only at this time that he breaks the
silence with which the whole ceremony is performed. The cloth is then
removed, and the rite is considered complete. <span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Measurement of Grain.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All these precautions are based on principles which
have been already discussed, and we meet in them with the familiar
fetishes and demon-scarers, of which we have already quoted
instances&mdash;the iron implements, the sacred grasses and plants,
water and milk, cowdung, the winnowing fan, and so on.</p>
<p>All over Northern India a piece of cowdung, known as Barh&acirc;wan,
&ldquo;that which gives the increase,&rdquo; is laid on the piled
grain, and a sacred circle is made with fire and water round it.
Silence, as we have already seen, is a special element in the worship.
All this rests on the idea that until the grain is measured, vagrant
Bh&ucirc;ts will steal or destroy it. This is something like the
principle of travellers, who keep a cowry or two in their purses, so
that thieves may not be able to divine the contents. So, in a Talmudic
legend we read, &ldquo;It is very difficult for devils to obtain money,
because men are careful to keep it locked or tied up; and we have no
power to take anything that is measured or counted; we are permitted to
take only what is free and common.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6632src" href="#xd21e6632" name="xd21e6632src">57</a></p>
<p>In the Eastern Panj&acirc;b grain must not be measured on the day of
the new or full moon, and Saturday is a bad day for it. It must be
begun at dawn, or sunset, or midnight, when the Bh&ucirc;ts are
otherwise engaged. Four men go inside the enclosure line with a wooden
measuring vessel, and no one must come near them till they have
finished. They sit facing the north and spread a cloth on the ground.
One fills the measure from the heap with the winnowing fan, another
empties it on the cloth, substituting an empty one for it. The man who
has the measure puts down for every measure filled a small heap of
grains of corn, by which the account is kept. Perfect silence must be
observed till the whole operation is finished, and especially all
counting aloud of the number of measures must be avoided. But when once
the grain is measured, it is safe from the Evil Eye; the people are at
liberty to quarrel over the division of it.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6637src" href="#xd21e6637" name="xd21e6637src">58</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=

<p>The same rule of silence often appears in the custom of Europe.
<i lang="la">Favete linguis</i> was the principle on such occasions in
Rome. So in the &ldquo;Tempest&rdquo; Prospero says,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd21e6647">&ldquo;Hush and be mute,</p>
<p class="line">Or else our spell is marred.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In the Highlands, on New Year&rsquo;s Day, a discreet
person is sent to draw a pitcher of water from the ford, which is drunk
next day as a charm against the spell of witchcraft, the malignity of
Evil Eyes, and the activity of all infernal agency. So the baker who
makes the bannocks on Shrove Tuesday must be mute as a stone; the cake
on St. Mark&rsquo;s Eve must be made in silence, and the same is the
rule on St. Faith&rsquo;s Day.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6653src"
href="#xd21e6653" name="xd21e6653src">59</a></p>
<p>The same rule of secrecy and silence is observed in the worship of
Dulha Deo. Among the Gaiti Gonds, their great festival is held after
the ingathering of the rice harvest, when they proceed to a dense part
of the jungle, which no woman is permitted to enter, and where, to
represent the great god, a copper coin has been hung up, enclosed in a
joint of bamboo. Arriving at the spot, they take down the copper god in
his case, and selecting a small area about a foot square, they lay on
it the copper coin, before which they arrange as many small heaps of
uncooked rice as there are deities worshipped by them. The chickens
brought for sacrifice are loosed and permitted to feed on the rice,
after which they are killed and their blood sprinkled between the
copper coin and the rice. Goats are also offered, and their blood
presented in the same manner. Until prohibited by the Hindus,
sacrifices of cows were also common. On the blood some country spirits
is poured as a libation to their deities. The copper coin is now
lifted, replaced in its bamboo case, which is shut up with leaves,
wrapped up in grass, and returned to its place in the tree, to remain
there till it is required on the following year.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">The Hol&icirc;: Its Origin.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The most famous and interesting of the village
festivals is the Hol&icirc;, which is held in the early spring, at the
full moon of Ph&acirc;lgun. One account of its origin describes it as
founded in honour of a female demon or R&acirc;kshas&icirc; called
Dundhas, &ldquo;she who would destroy many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another account connects the observance with the well-known legend
of Hiranya-kasipu, &ldquo;golden-dressed,&rdquo; and his son
Prahl&acirc;da. Hiranya-kasipu was, it is said, a Daitya, who obtained
from Siva the sovereignty of the three worlds for a million years, and
persecuted his pious son Prahl&acirc;da because he was such a devoted
worshipper of Vishnu. Finally the angry god, in his Nara-sinha or
man-lion incarnation, slew the sinner.</p>
<p>Harn&acirc;kas, as the father is called in the modern version of the
story, was an ascetic, who claimed that the devotion of the world was
to be paid to him alone. His son Prahl&acirc;da became a devotee of
Vishnu, and performed various miracles, such as saving a cat and her
kittens out of the blazing kiln of a potter. His father was enraged at
what he considered the apostasy of his son, and with the assistance of
his sister Hol&icirc; or Holik&acirc;, commenced to torture
Prahl&acirc;da. Many attempts on his life failed, and finally Vishnu
himself entered a pillar of heated iron, which had been prepared for
the destruction of Prahl&acirc;da, and tore Harn&acirc;kas to pieces.
Then Hol&icirc; tried to burn herself and Prahl&acirc;da together, but
the fire left him unscathed and she was consumed. The fire is now
supposed to be burnt in commemoration of this tragedy.</p>
<p>This legend has been localized at a place called Deokali near Irichh
in the Jh&acirc;nsi District, where Hiranya-kasipu is said to have had
his palace. Just below it is a deep pool, into which Prahl&acirc;da was
flung by the orders of his father, and the mark of the foot of the
martyr is still shown on a neighbouring rock.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6674src" href="#xd21e6674" name="xd21e6674src">61</a></p>
<p>Another legend identifies Hol&icirc; with the witch
P&ucirc;tan&acirc;, who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href=
"#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>attempted to destroy the infant
Krishna by giving him her poisoned nipple to suck.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6681src" href="#xd21e6681" name="xd21e6681src">62</a></p>
<p>Lastly, a tale told at Hardw&acirc;r brings us probably nearer the
real origin of the rite. Holik&acirc; or Hol&icirc; was, they say,
sister of Sambat or Sanvat, the Hindu year. Once, at the beginning of
all things, Sambat died, and Hol&icirc; in her excessive love for her
brother insisted on being burnt on his pyre, and by her devotion he was
restored to life. The Hol&icirc; fire is now burnt every year to
commemorate this tragedy.</p>

<h3 class="main">Propitiation of Sunshine.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There seems to be little doubt that the custom of
burning the Hol&icirc; fire rests on the same basis as that of similar
observances in Europe. The whole subject has recently been copiously
illustrated by Mr. J. G. Frazer.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6694src"
href="#xd21e6694" name="xd21e6694src">63</a> His conclusion is that
&ldquo;they are sun charms or magical ceremonies intended to ensure a
proper supply of sunshine for men, animals, and plants. We have seen
that savages resort to charms for making sunshine, and we need not
wonder that primitive man in Europe has done the same. Indeed,
considering the cold and cloudy climate of Europe during a considerable
portion of the year, it is natural that sun charms should have played a
much more prominent part among the superstitious practices of European
peoples than among those of savages who live near the equator. This
view of the festival in question is supported by various considerations
drawn partly from the rites themselves, partly from the influences they
are believed to exert on the weather and on vegetation. For example,
the custom of rolling a burning wheel down a hill-side, which is often
observed on these occasions, seems a very natural imitation of the
sun&rsquo;s course in the sky, and the imitation is particularly
appropriate on Midsummer Day, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315"
href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>when the sun&rsquo;s annual
declension begins. Not less graphic is the imitation of his apparent
revolution by swinging a burning tar barrel round a pole. The custom of
throwing blazing discs, shaped like suns, into the air, is probably
also a piece of imitative magic.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6699src" href="#xd21e6699" name="xd21e6699src">64</a> In these,
as in so many cases, the magic force is supposed to take effect through
mimicry or sympathy.</p>
<p>It is true, of course, that the climatic conditions of Northern
India do not, as a rule, necessitate the use of incantations to produce
sunshine. But it must be remembered that the native of the country does
not look on the fierceness of the summer sun with the same dread as is
felt by Europeans. To him it is about the most pleasant and healthy
season of the year, and people who are sometimes underfed and nearly
always insufficiently dressed have more reason to fear the chills of
December and January than the warmth of May and June. It is also
usually recognized in popular belief that seasonable and sufficient
rainfall depends on the due supply of sunshine.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Hol&icirc; Observances.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Hol&icirc;, while generally observed in Northern
India, is performed with special care by the cowherd classes of the
land of Braj, or the region round the city of Mathura, where the myth
of Krishna has been localized, and it is here that we meet with some
curious incidents which are undoubtedly survivals of the most primitive
usages.</p>
<p>The ceremonies in vogue at Mathura have been very carefully recorded
by Mr. Growse.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6712src" href="#xd21e6712"
name="xd21e6712src">65</a> He notes &ldquo;the cheeriness of the
holiday-makers as they throng the narrow, winding streets on their way
to and from the central square of the town of Bars&acirc;na, where they
break into groups of bright and ever varying combinations of colour,
with the buffooneries of the village clowns, and the grotesque dances
of the lusty swains, who, with castanets in hand, caricature in their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=
"pb316">316</a>]</span>movements the conventional graces of the Indian
ballet girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then follows a mock fight between the men of the adjoining
village of Nandg&acirc;nw and the women of Bars&acirc;na. The women
have their mantles drawn down over their faces and are armed with long,
heavy bamboos, with which they deal their opponents many shrewd blows
on the head and shoulders. The latter defend themselves as best they
can with round leather shields and stag horns, as they dodge in and out
among the crowd, and now and again have their flight cut off, and are
driven back upon the crowd of excited viragoes. Many laughable
incidents occur. Not unfrequently blood is drawn; but an accident of
this kind is regarded rather as an omen of good fortune, and has never
been known to give rise to any ill-feeling. Whenever the fury of their
female assailants appears to be subsiding, it is again excited by the
men shouting at them snatches of ribald rhymes.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Lighting of the Hol&icirc; Fire.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Next day the Hol&icirc; fire is lit. By immemorial
custom, the boys are allowed to appropriate fuel of any kind for the
fire, the wood-work of deserted houses, fences, and the like, and the
owner never dares to complain. We have the same custom in England. The
chorus of the Oxfordshire song sung at the feast of Gunpowder Plot
runs,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd21e6647">A stick and a stake</p>
<p class="line">For King James&rsquo;s sake;</p>
<p class="line">If you won&rsquo;t give me one,</p>
<p class="line xd21e6647">I&rsquo;ll take two,</p>
<p class="line">The better for me,</p>
<p class="line">The worse for you.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This is chanted by the boys when collecting sticks for
the bonfire, and it is considered quite lawful to appropriate any old
wood they can lay hands on after the recitation of these
lines.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6739src" href="#xd21e6739" name=
"xd21e6739src">66</a></p>
<p>Mr. Growse goes on to describe how a large bonfire had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>been
stacked between the pond and the temple of Prahl&acirc;da (who, as we
have already seen, is connected with the legend), inside which the
local village priest, the Kherapat or Panda, who was to take the chief
part in the performance of the day, was sitting, telling his beads. At
6 p.m. the pile was lit, and being composed of the most inflammable
materials, at once burst into a tremendous blaze. The lads of the
village kept running close round it, jumping and dancing and
brandishing their bludgeons, while the Panda went round and dipped in
the pond, and then with his dripping turban and loin-cloth ran back and
made a feint of passing through the fire. In reality he only jumped
over the outermost verge of the smouldering ashes, and then dashed into
his cell again, much to the dissatisfaction of the spectators, who say
that the former incumbent used to do it much more thoroughly. If on the
next recurrence of the festival the Panda shows himself equally timid,
the village proprietors threaten to eject him as an impostor from the
land which he holds rent-free, simply on the score of his being
fire-proof.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to say that this custom of jumping through
the fire prevails in many other places. We have already had an instance
of it in the case of the fire worship of R&acirc;hu. In Greece people
jump through the bonfires lighted on St. John&rsquo;s Eve. The Irish
make their cattle pass through the fire, and children are passed
through it in the arms of their fathers. The passing of victims through
the fire in honour of Moloch is well known.<a class="noteref" id=

the great timbrels with branches of peacocks&rsquo; feathers,
artificial flowers and tinsel stars stuck in their rims, borne above
the players&rsquo; heads, and now and then tossed up in the air,
combined to form a curious and picturesque spectacle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then followed another mock fight between men and women, conducted
with perfect good-humour on both sides, and when it was all over, many
of the spectators ran into the arena, and rolled over and over in the
dust, or streaked themselves with it on the forehead, taking it as the
dust hallowed by the feet of Krishna and the Gop&icirc;s.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Basis of the Hol&icirc; Rite.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have seen that the primary basis of this and
similar rites is probably the propitiation of sunshine. But the present
observances in India are probably a survival of a very much more
primitive cultus. We have already seen that in one form of the popular
legend, Hol&icirc; is the sister of Sambat, the year, and revived him
from death by burning herself with his corpse. We find the same idea in
Nep&acirc;l, where a wooden post adorned with flags is erected in front
of the palace, and this is burned at night, representing the burning of
the body of the old year, and its re-birth with each succeeding
spring.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6789src" href="#xd21e6789" name=
"xd21e6789src">70</a></p>
<p>The Dr&acirc;vidian Hill tribes of Mirzapur do not perform the
Hol&icirc; ceremony like their Hindu neighbours, but on the same date
the Baiga burns a stake, a ceremony which is known as Sambat
Jal&acirc;n&acirc;, or &ldquo;the burning of the old year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Kumaun each clan puts up the Ch&icirc;r or rag-tree. A
middle-sized tree or a large branch is cut down and stripped of its
leaves. Young men go round and beg scraps of cloth, which are tied to
the tree, and it is then set up in the middle of the village. Near it
the Hol&icirc; fire is burnt. On the last day the tree itself is burnt,
and the people jump over the ashes as a cure for itch and similar
diseases. While the tree is burning, men of other clans try to snatch
away some of the rags. It is regarded as being very propitious to be
able to do this, and the clan which loses is not allowed to set up the
tree again. Faction fighting in order to gain the right of setting up
the tree has practically ceased under British law.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6796src" href="#xd21e6796" name="xd21e6796src">71</a></p>
<p>The ceremony in another form appears at Gw&acirc;lior. There,
instead of a tree, they burn large heaps of cowdung fuel. The
Marw&acirc;ris erect a nude figure known as Nathur&acirc;m, made of
bricks, of a most disgusting shape. This, when the pile of cowdung
cakes is consumed, is broken to pieces <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>with blows of shoes
and bludgeons. Another beautifully carved image of the same kind is
paraded through the bazars and kept safely from year to year. This
Nathur&acirc;m is said to have been a scamp from some part of Northern
India, who went to M&acirc;rw&acirc;r and seduced a number of women,
until he was detected and put to death. He then became a malignant
ghost and began to torment women and children, and now his spirit can
be appeased only by a series of indecent songs and gestures performed
by the women. No M&acirc;rw&acirc;ri household is without an image of
Nathur&acirc;m, and a representation of him is laid with the married
pair after the wedding, while barren women and those whose children die
pray to him for offspring. He is in short a phallic fetish.</p>
<p>The Hol&icirc;, then, in its most primitive form, is possibly an
aboriginal usage which has been imported into Br&acirc;hmanism. This is
specially shown by the functions of the Kherapat or village priest, who
lights the fire. He is sometimes a Br&acirc;hman, but often a man drawn
from the lower races. As we have seen, his duties among the
Dr&acirc;vidian races are performed by the Baiga, who is always drawn
from the non-Aryan races. It seems probable that the legends connecting
the rite with Prahl&acirc;da and Krishna are a subsequent invention,
and that the fire is really intended to represent the burning of the
old year and the re-birth of the new, which they pray may be more
propitious to the families, cattle, and crops of the worshippers. The
observance seems also to include certain ceremonies intended to scare
the evil spirits which bring disease and famine. The compulsory entry
of the local priests into the fire can hardly be anything but a
survival of human sacrifice, intended to secure the same results; and
the dancing, singing, waving of flags, screaming, the mock fight, and
the throwing of red powder, a colour supposed, as we have seen, to be
obnoxious to evil spirits, are probably based on the same train of
ideas.</p>
<p>Finally comes the indecency of word and gesture, which is a distinct
element in the rite. There seems reason to believe that in the worship
of certain deities in spring, promiscuous intercourse was regarded as a
necessary part of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href=
"#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>ceremony.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6809src" href="#xd21e6809" name="xd21e6809src">72</a> This
appears at what is called the K&acirc;hi ka Mela in Kulu, in which
indecency is supposed to scare evil spirits.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6812src" href="#xd21e6812" name="xd21e6812src">73</a> We have
already noticed the practice of indecency as a rain charm, and it seems
at least a plausible hypothesis that the unchecked profligacy which
prevails among the Hindus at the spring feast and at the Kajal&icirc;
in autumn may be intended to repel evil spirits which check the
fecundity of men, animals, and crops. The same idea probably also
underlies the licentious observance of the Karama among the
Dr&acirc;vidian races. The same theory explains similar usages in
Europe, such as the Lupercalia, Festum Stultorum, Matronalia Festa,
Liberalia, and our own All Fools&rsquo; Day, where the indecent part of
the performance has disappeared under the influence of a purer faith
and a higher morality, and a little kindly merriment is its only
survival.</p>
<p>Of the mock fight as a charm for rain we have spoken already, and at
the Hol&icirc; it may be merely a fertility charm. Of these mock fights
we have numerous instances in the customs of Northern India. Thus, in
Kumaun, in former days at the Bagw&acirc;h festival the males of
several villages used to divide into two bodies and sling stones at
each other across a stream. The results were so serious that it was
suppressed after the British occupation of the country.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6817src" href="#xd21e6817" name=
"xd21e6817src">74</a> The people in some places attribute the increase
of cholera and other plagues to its discontinuance. In the plains, the
custom survives in what is known as the Barra, when the men of two
villages have a sort of Tug of War with a rope across the boundary of
the village. Plenty is supposed to follow the side which is
victorious.</p>
<p>Another of these spring rites is that known as the R&acirc;li ka
Mela in K&acirc;ngra, the R&acirc;li being a sort of rude image of Siva
or P&acirc;rvat&icirc;. The girls of the village in March take baskets
of D&ucirc;b grass and flowers, of which they make a heap in a selected
place. Round this they walk and sing for ten days, and then they erect
two images of Siva and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href=
"#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>P&acirc;rvat&icirc;, who are
married according to the regular rites. At the conjunction or
Sankr&acirc;nt in the month of Bais&acirc;kh the images are flung into
a pool and mock funeral obsequies are performed. The object of the
ceremonial is said to be to secure a good husband.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6824src" href="#xd21e6824" name="xd21e6824src">75</a></p>
<p>In Gorakhpur this spring rite takes the form of hunting and
crucifying a monkey on the village boundary. This is said to be
intended to scare these animals, which injure the crops. But the rite
seems to be intended to secure fertility, and is possibly the survival
of an actual sacrifice.</p>
<p>Of the same class is what is known in the Hills as the Badw&acirc;r
rite, where a Dom, one of the menial castes, is made to slide down a
rope from a high precipice. The intention is to promote the fertility
of the crops and expel the demons of disease.</p>

<h3 class="main">Marriage of the Powers of Vegetation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mr. Frazer has collected instances of the marriage of
the powers of vegetation, of which we have a survival in the English
King and Queen of the May. This seems to be the explanation of the
remarkable rite among the Kharw&acirc;rs, of which Mr. Forbes has given
an account.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6836src" href="#xd21e6836" name=
"xd21e6836src">76</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the most remarkable of the Kharw&acirc;r deities is
called Durg&acirc;giya Deot&acirc;; this spirit rejoices in the name of
M&ucirc;chak R&acirc;n&icirc;. She is a Cham&acirc;rin by caste, and
her home is on a hill called Buhor&acirc;j; her priests are Baigas. All
the Kharw&acirc;rs regard her with great veneration, and offer up pigs
and fowls to her several times during the year. Once a year, in the
month of Aghan, what is called the K&acirc;ruj P&ucirc;j&acirc; takes
place in her honour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ceremony is performed in the village threshing-floor,
when a kind of bread and kids are offered up. Once in three years the
ceremony of marrying the R&acirc;n&icirc; is performed with great pomp.
Early in the morning of the bridal day both men and women assemble with
drums and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span>horns, form themselves into procession and
ascend the hill, singing a wild song in honour of the bride and
bridegroom. One of the party is constituted the priest, who is to
perform the wedding ceremony. This man ascends the hill in front of the
procession, shouting and dancing till he works himself into a frenzy.
The procession halts at the mouth of a cave, which does, or is supposed
to, exist on the top of the hill. The priest then enters the cave and
returns bearing with him the R&acirc;n&icirc;, who is represented as a
small oblong-shaped and smooth stone, daubed over with red lead. After
going through certain antics, a piece of Tasar silk cloth is placed on
the R&acirc;n&icirc;&rsquo;s head, and a new sheet is placed below her,
the four corners being tied up in such a manner as to allow the
R&acirc;n&icirc;, who is now supposed to be seated in her bridal couch,
to be slung on a bamboo, and carried like a dooly or palanquin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The procession then descends the hill and halts under a
Banyan tree till noon, when the marriage procession starts for the home
of the bridegroom, who resides on the Kandi hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On their arrival there, offerings, consisting of sweetened
milk, two copper pice, and two bell-metal wristlets, are presented to
the bride, who is taken out of her dooly and put into the cave in which
the bridegroom, who, by the way, is of the Agariya caste, resides. This
cave is supposed to be of immense depth, for the stone goes rolling
down, striking the rocks as it falls, and the people all listen eagerly
till the sound dies out, which they say it does not do for nearly half
an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When all is silent, the people return rejoicing down the
hill, and finish off the evening with a dance. The strangest part of
the story is that the people believe that the caves on the two hills
are connected, and that every third year the R&acirc;n&icirc; returns
to her father&rsquo;s house. They implicitly believe that the stone
yearly produced is the same. The village Baigas could probably explain
the mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In former times the marriage used to take place every year,
but on one occasion, on the morning succeeding the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span>marriage ceremony, the R&acirc;n&icirc; made her
appearance in the Baiga&rsquo;s house. The Baiga himself was not
present, but his wife, who was at home, was very indignant at this
flightiness on the part of the R&acirc;n&icirc;, and the idea of her
going about the country the morning after her marriage so shocked the
Baig&acirc;in&rsquo;s sense of propriety, that she gave the
R&acirc;n&icirc; a good setting down, and called upon her to explain
herself, and as she could give no satisfactory account of her conduct,
she was punished by being married every three years, instead of yearly
as before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mock marriage of Gh&acirc;zi Miy&acirc;n, to which some
reference has been already made, a very favourite rite among the
Musalm&acirc;ns and low Hindu castes of the North-Western Provinces, is
very possibly the survival of some non-Aryan rite of this kind,
performed to secure the annual revival of the year and the powers of
vegetation.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Dr&acirc;vidian Saturnalia.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Some of the Dr&acirc;vidian tribes enjoy the
Saturnalia in other forms.</p>
<p>Thus, the Gond women have the curious festival known as
Gurt&ucirc;tn&acirc; or &ldquo;breaking of the sugar.&rdquo; &ldquo;A
stout pole about twelve or fifteen feet high is set up, and a lump of
coarse sugar with a rupee in it placed on the top; round it the Gond
women take their stand, each with a little green tamarind rod in her
hands. The men collect outside, and each has a kind of shield made of
two parallel sticks joined with a cross-piece held in the hand to
protect themselves from the blows. They make a rush together, and one
of them swarms up the pole, the women all the time plying their rods
vigorously; and it is no child&rsquo;s play, as the men&rsquo;s backs
attest next day. When the man gets to the top, he takes the piece of
sugar, slips down, and gets off as rapidly as he can. This is done five
or six times over with the greatest good-humour, and generally ends
with an attack of the women <i>en masse</i> upon the men. It is the
regular Saturnalia for the women, who lose all respect, even for a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>settlement officer; and on one occasion when he
was looking on, he only escaped by the most abject submission and
presentation of rupees.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6869src"
href="#xd21e6869" name="xd21e6869src">77</a></p>
<p>The Bh&icirc;ls of Gujar&acirc;t plant a small tree or branch firmly
in the ground. The women stand near it, and the men outside. One man
rushing in tries to uproot the tree, and the men and women fall upon
him and beat him so soundly that he has to retire. He is succeeded by
another, who is belaboured in the same way, and this goes on till one
man succeeds in bearing off the tree, but seldom without a load of
blows which cripples him for days.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6874src"
href="#xd21e6874" name="xd21e6874src">78</a></p>
<p>All these mock combats have their parallels in English customs, such
as the throwing of the hood at Haxey, the football match at Derby, the
fighting on Lammas Day at Lothian, and hunting of the ram at
Eton.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6879src" href="#xd21e6879" name=

<h3 class="main">The Desauli of the Hos.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Hos of Chutia N&acirc;gpur have a similar
festival, the Desauli held in January, &ldquo;when the granaries are
full of grain, and the people are, to use their own expression,
&lsquo;full of devilry!&rsquo; They have a strange notion that at this
period men and women are so overcharged with vicious propensities that
it is absolutely necessary for the safety of the person to let off
steam by allowing for the time full vent to the passions. The festival,
therefore, becomes a sort of Saturnalia, during which servants forget
their duty to their masters, children their reverence for their
parents, men their respect for women, and women all notions of
gentleness, modesty, and delicacy; they become raging Bacchantes. It
opens with a sacrifice to Desauli of three fowls, a cock and two hens,
one of which must be black, and offered with some flowers of the
Pal&acirc;sa tree (<i>Butea frondosa</i>), bread made from rice flour
and sesamum seeds. The sacrifice and offering are made by the village
priest, if there be one, or if not by any elder of the village who
possesses the necessary legendary lore; and he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>prays that during the year they are going to
enter on they and their children may be preserved from all misfortune
and sickness, and that they may have seasonable rain and good crops.
Prayer is also made in some places for the souls of the departed. At
this period an evil spirit is supposed to infest the locality, and to
get rid of it, men, women, and children go in procession round and
through every part of the village with sticks in their hands, as if
beating for game, singing a wild chant and vociferating loudly, till
they feel assured that the bad spirit must have fled, and they make
noise enough to frighten a legion. These religious ceremonies over, the
people give themselves up to feasting, drinking immoderately of
rice-beer till they are in a state of wild ebriety most suitable for
the purpose of letting off steam.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>With these survivals of perhaps the most primitive observances of
the races of Northern India we may close this survey of their religion
and folk-lore. To use Dr. Tylor&rsquo;s words in speaking of savage
religions generally, &ldquo;Far from its beliefs and practices being a
rubbish heap of miscellaneous folly, they are consistent and logical in
so high a degree as to begin, as soon as even roughly classified, to
display the principles of their formation and development; and these
principles prove to be essentially rational, though working in a mental
condition of intense and inveterate ignorance.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
